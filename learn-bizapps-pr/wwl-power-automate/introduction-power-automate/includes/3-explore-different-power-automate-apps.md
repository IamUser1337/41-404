Desktop flows are addressed to essentially everyone who is performing simple or complex rule-based tasks on their workstations. Users at home, small businesses, enterprises, or larger companies can use automation capabilities in Power Automate to create flows. These flows interact with everyday tools like email and Excel, or work with modern and legacy applications. 

Examples of simple and complex tasks you can automate are:

- Quickly organize your documents using dedicated files and folders actions

- Accurately extract data from websites and store them in Excel files using web and Excel automation

- Apply desktop automation capabilities to put your work on autopilot

Power Automate covers many use cases. These use cases include the home user who is accessing a weather website to see tomorrow's forecast, the self-employed businessperson extracting information from vendors' invoices, or even an employee of a large enterprise who automates data entry on an ERP system.

It allows you to automate legacy applications, such as terminal emulators, modern web and desktop applications, Excel files, and folders. You can interact with the machine using application UI elements, images, or coordinates.
