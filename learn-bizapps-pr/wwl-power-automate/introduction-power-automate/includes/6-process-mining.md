As organizations start to look at how to best use automation to streamline their business, a key step is process mining. Process mining helps organizations gain a better understanding of their real processes, how they're operated, and identify opportunities for improvement, automation, and digitization.

Process mining in Power Automate works with the existing Microsoft platform and ecosystem to provide end-to-end solutions and enable faster business decisions. It helps extract event data from your system of records and visualizes your different processes to allow you to customize your process mining reports, compare processes, determine the root cause of inefficiencies, and monitor KPIs.

Overall, the process mining capability is a valuable tool for businesses seeking to improve their operational efficiency and make informed decisions.
