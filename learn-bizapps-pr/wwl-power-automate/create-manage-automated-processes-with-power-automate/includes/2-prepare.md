## Project specification
Contoso Coffee produces consumer and commercial coffee makers. The sales team uses Dataverse to keep track of opportunities but is looking for help with ensuring that open opportunities aren't missed. 

Sales opportunities previously were tracked using offline Excel spreadsheets, causing opportunities to be missed. Contoso Coffee wants to begin using Dataverse to keep track of opportunities and Power Automate to share open opportunities with the sales team daily. 

Some simple automation provides the sales team  an easy way to reduce the time waiting on the customer information and ensure sales opportunities aren't missed.
