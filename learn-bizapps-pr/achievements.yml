  title: Introduction to creating measures using DAX in Power BI
  summary: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values. You can use DAX to solve a number of calculations and data analysis problems, which can help you create new information from data that is already in your model.

  title: Add DAX calculation groups to Power BI Desktop models
  summary: "Occasionally, you might need to add many similar measures to your model. For example, consider that your model includes measures for sales, cost, and profit. You then want to create a report that shows year-to-date (YTD) sales, YTD cost, and YTD profit, in addition to prior year (PY) sales, PY cost, and PY profit.\nAdding numerous measures can be time-consuming and can clutter the Fields pane with an overwhelming number of fields. Instead of creating each YTD and PY measure, you can quickly add these measures to your model by creating a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) calculation group."

  title: Structure analytical report designs in Power BI
  summary: "Designing an analytical report involves understanding the requirements and its audience. However, designing a compelling analytical report requires understanding the automatic and unconscious processes that occur when report consumers comprehend what they see. When you have the knowledge of how to structure and apply report design principles, you can raise the level of your report designs to produce relevant, intuitive, and visually pleasing experiences for your report consumers."
