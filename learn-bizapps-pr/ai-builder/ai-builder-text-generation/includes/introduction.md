Text generation capability is a powerful tool in AI Builder. It helps you to create custom AI capabilities quickly and easily for natural language processing (NLP).

This capability enables you to build many use case scenarios, such as:

- Sentiment analysis

- Text classification

- Named entity recognition

- Summarization

- Translation

- Content recommendation

- Document clustering

- Content creation

It also allows you to use large language models for various purposes.
