  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.
  questions:
  - content: What is text generation?
    choices:
    - content: A type of natural language processing task that involves generating text from a given input.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Text generation refers to the process of generating natural language text by using machine learning models. You can use it for various applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation.
    - content: A type of machine-learning algorithm that can classify text into different categories.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Text generation refers to the process of generating natural language text by using machine learning models. You can use it for various applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation.
    - content: A type of data visualization technique that uses text to represent data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Text generation refers to the process of generating natural language text by using machine learning models. You can use it for various applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation.
  - content: What can you use the text generation capability for?
    choices:
    - content: Chatbots
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Partially correct. The text generation capability enables you to build scenarios such as summarization, information extraction, autogenerate response, classification, translation, and more.
    - content: Language translation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Partially correct. The text generation capability enables you to build scenarios such as summarization, information extraction, autogenerate response, classification, translation, and more.
    - content: Content creation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Partially correct. The text generation capability enables you to build scenarios such as summarization, information extraction, autogenerate response, classification, translation, and more.
    - content: All are correct
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The text generation capability enables you to build scenarios such as summarization, information extraction, autogenerate response, classification, translation, and more.
  - content: What is human oversight?
    choices:
    - content: A process that ensures that AI systems are transparent and explainable
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Human oversight is an important step in ensuring that the content that’s generated by the GPT model is as intended and aligned with goals and objectives of the desired solution.
    - content: A process that ensures that AI systems are opaque and unexplainable
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Human oversight is an important step in ensuring that the content that’s generated by the GPT model is as intended and aligned with goals and objectives of the desired solution.
    - content: A process that ensures that AI systems are biased
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Human oversight is an important step in ensuring that the content that’s generated by the GPT model is as intended and aligned with goals and objectives of the desired solution.
  - content: Can I use Prompt Engineering to refine my Generated Text?
    choices:
    - content: No, you can't
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Prompt Engineering ensures that the generated text is more relevant and useful.
    - content: Yes, you can
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Prompt Engineering ensures that the generated text is more relevant and useful.
