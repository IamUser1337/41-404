Setting up a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot for voice support means that you can use the same conversational style bot that you're using with traditional text-based channels, such as chats, text, or social media, across voice channels. Customers who are on the phone can have a natural conversation with the bot, which will interact with and assist them as a live person would. Customers who are using Dynamics 365 voice offering can enable voice functionality for any Microsoft Copilot Studio bot that they create, without needing to do anything different during the design process of the bot.    

In this module, you learned how to set up a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot for voice capabilities and to: 
- Use voice with automated bots.    
- Deploy the necessary extension so that your bot can support voice capabilities.  
- Enable voice functionality and set up your bot to work with Omnichannel for Customer Service.        
- Call your voice-enabled bot from a voice workstream in Omnichannel for Customer Service.
