With customers demanding more personalized and efficient customer service experiences, organizations are turning to copilots. Copilots help provide customers with a self-service support solution that can be interacted with through natural language that simulates human conversation. Copilots can resolve simple or common issues, allowing agents to focus on more complicated issues that might require more time. Copilots can incorporate information from other systems into the conversation to provide a personalized experience to customers, including the ability to schedule meetings, assign cases, or send emails. With Microsoft Copilot Studio, organizations can create powerful copilots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. Organizations can use the power of copilots to eliminate the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams. Copilots can also remove the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code.

This module examined how to get started with Microsoft Copilot Studio, create and deploy copilots, and deploy them for consumption across multiple channels, including:

- Introducing copilots, explaining where they're being used, and providing an overview of how Microsoft Copilot Studio can be used to create copilots.

- Examining how to work with and create copilots in different environments to tailor the copilot content that is being used based on factors such as teams, regions, or other factors.

- Reviewing the process for creating a copilot and how to work with the Microsoft Copilot Studio user interface.

- Explaining what topics are, the different types that are available, and how they're used as part of a copilot.

- Examining the tools that are available to assist you with testing your copilot.

- Reviewing the process for publishing a copilot so that it can be made available across multiple channels and describing the analytics that are available when the copilot is published.

Your next step would be to gain a deeper understanding of how to design effective conversation paths to provide users with a better overall experience. This other learning would include:

- Gaining a deeper understanding of what conversation nodes are available

- Examining how entities and variables can be used to capture and store relevant data

- And examining the tools that are available for topic management

You can also use Customer Service Insights to analyze the support topics that come through your entire support operation and understand which to consider automating through Microsoft Copilot Studio.
