Before you start Copilots, it's important to consider what it's used for. For example, you might use it to handle account inquiries, or you could use it for self-service support cases such as knowledge base access. Knowing how you plan to use the copilot helps you define and plot out conversation paths and determine how many topics the copilot will handle. Other functions that you could consider include using it to look up basic account details, perform more advanced account operations, or implement some type of action. The more scenarios that you initially consider, the easier it's to determine the topics that your copilot needs for you to facilitate it.

You can create copilots by selecting the copilot icon in the Microsoft Copilot Studio interface. Copilots are created for each environment. By default, all copilots are created in the [default Power Apps environment for your organization or tenant](/power-virtual-agents/environments-first-run-experience/?azure-portal=true), unless otherwise specified. You can choose which environment that you want to use by selecting **more options** to see a list of available environments.

In the **Create a new Copilot** dialog box, enter a name for your copilot. Select **Create** to begin the copilot-building process, which can take up to 15 minutes for the first copilot that you create in an environment. You can also use generated answers in your copilot, by selecting a website to attach to.

## Delete a Copilot

Copilots that are no longer needed can be removed from your environment. This situation might occur when the copilot is being replaced with a different copilot, or if the copilot no longer fits the needs of your organization. Using the copilots menu, select copilot that you want to delete. Select the **Delete** button on the command bar to delete the copilot.
