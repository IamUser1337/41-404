You can use the following scenario throughout the exercises to build your bot. You can also use your own scenarios if you prefer.

## Scenario: Contoso Coffee customer support

Contoso Coffee is passionate about providing efficient, environmentally sustainable, and innovative coffee products, barista experiences, and services.

Consumer sentiment is at an all-time high, but with increasing competition, it's important to minimize costs and focus on customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the company can maintain its competitive edge in having a robust customer base while continuing to reinvest in the customer experience and maximize their customer lifetime value.

Contoso Coffee wants to provide customers with the ability to ask questions about their order status and delivery time and to modify their order and cancel it. This new initiative will unlock some capabilities for the call center staff and will help deflect common questions that are time-consuming on the phone, ensuring greater customer satisfaction and saving agents' time. Additionally, they've briefly indicated that, in B2B scenarios where they often work with other manufacturers, they want those partners to have the ability to view and ask questions about latest invoices or payments or to be escalated to live agents if they're in a specific tier of manufacturer.

Customer support costs have continued to rise as the customer base has grown, and the company can no longer continue to expand its customer support team. As a result, you've been tasked with helping them find a solution by using Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Prerequisites

Some labs, especially later ones, reference previous labs in regard to capabilities and previous tasks. The exercises have been designed so that, as long as you have access to a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial where you use the latest unified authoring canvas, you can get started from any exercise without needing to complete the previous module to move forward. However, for the best experience in learning about the productâ€™s features and functionality, we recommend that you complete specific modules before starting some exercises.

For the **Create your first chatbot** module, we recommend that you first complete the following modules to get the best experience:

- Overview

- Plan your first chatbot

As previously mentioned in other modules in this learning path, to continue with the labs in this module, you'll also need to ensure that you have access to the environment that you've created.

## Goals for this module

The goal for this module is to show you how to:

- Create a new chatbot by using the unified authoring canvas in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Create your first topic and add content to the topic, including rich text responses and more.
- Use the **New Copilot** feature in Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a topic with AI.
- Learn how to test your bot in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Publish your bot on a demo website.
