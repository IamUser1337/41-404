Employees who have quick access to information make better decisions, reduce errors, and save money. Chatbots create a personalized experience that simplifies how employees get information. Microsoft Copilot Studio and Microsoft Dataverse for Teams create intelligent copilots to quickly respond to employee needs without building high-code solutions.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

-   Create a copilot.

-   Use the copilot to call Microsoft Power Automate actions to retrieve data from Dataverse for Teams.

-   Publish the copilot to your team or the whole company.

This module goes through the process of creating, editing, and then publishing a copilot that provides contact information for an event planning team.
