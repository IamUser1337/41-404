When the copilot is tested and ready, you need to publish it so that users can interact with it. You must republish your copilot anytime after you edit it if you want users to be able to access the latest content. By having a published version, you can make future updates to the copilot without impacting current users.

The first time you publish a copilot, only members of the team that the copilot is associated with can access it. You can direct team members to the copilot by providing them with a link or by adding the copilot to the **Built by your colleagues** section in Teams.

If the copilot is for the whole organization, you'll submit it for review by your Teams admin. After it has been approved, the copilot will be accessible to all users and will appear in the **Built by your org** section in Teams.

## Publish the copilot

To publish the copilot, follow these steps:

1. Open the copilot for editing in Teams by using the Microsoft Copilot Studio app.

1. Select the **Publish** option from the left-side menu to go to the **Publish** panel.

1. In the **Publish** panel for your copilot, select the **Publish** button. Copilot Studio will confirm that you want to publish your latest content; select **Publish** to confirm.

1. The **Microsoft Teams** panel will appear on the right side of your screen. You can review how the copilot will appear by selecting **Edit details**. You can change the color and/or icon, add a **Short description** and a **Long description**, toggle whether or not you want your users to be able to add your copilot to a team, and even provide developer information (under the **More** options).

	Before publishing a copilot to the whole organization, you should provide more information to your users by editing the details that will appear in the **Teams app store**.

1. Once you're satisfied with the details of your app, select **Availability options** to continue. The **Microsoft Teams** panel provides you with a menu of options including:

- **Copy link** - to send users a link to the copilot.

- **Add to a team** - Add the copilot a particular team. When you select this option, anyone in the designated team will be able to chat with your copilot in private and by @mentioning the copilot in team channels.

- **Show in Teams app store** - Provides two options to show your app in the Teams app store: 1) show to your teammates and shared users, which will appear under the "Built by your colleagues" section or 2) show to everyone in your org, which will make the copilot appear in the "Built by your org" section.

> [!NOTE]
> - Only team members can use the link or see the copilot that is listed in the **Built by your colleagues** section in Teams. 
>- Publishing to the entire organization requires administrative approval, whereas adding your copilot to a team does not require admin involvement.


## Share your copilot with your organization

For the entire organization to access the copilot, you must submit a **request for admin approval**. After the Teams admin has approved the request, all users will have access and the copilot will appear in the **Built by your org** section in the Teams app store. Any users can then discover and install the copilot through the Teams app store.

To submit the request:

1. From the **Publish** panel for your copilot, select **Availability options**.

	>[!NOTE]
	>You may want to confirm that the app isn't already published to the app store for team members so they won't see the app twice in the Teams app store. Select **Remove** under **Share with my team** if it has already been published.

1. Under the **Show in Teams app store** select **Show to everyone in my org**.

1. Review the requirements for submission and then select **Submit for admin approval**.

1. Copilot Studio will ask you to confirm this action via a popup; you can select **Yes** to continue.

The request is sent to the Teams admin for approval. You can check the request's status by opening the **Publish** option and then selecting **Share the bot**. After the copilot has been approved, it will appear in the **Built by your org** section of the Teams app store for everyone in your organization.
