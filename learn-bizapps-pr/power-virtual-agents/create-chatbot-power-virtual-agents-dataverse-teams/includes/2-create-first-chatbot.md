To create copilots (also referred to as *bots*), first install the Microsoft Copilot Studio app in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to:

- Create and edit copilots.

- Test the copilot to see how well it works.

- Publish the copilot to your team or organization.

- Review the copilot's performance over time, note the questions that are asked, and assess how well it's answering questions.

To install Microsoft Copilot Studio for Teams:

1. Open Teams and then select **Apps** from the left navigation bar.

1. Enter "copilot" in the search box and then select **Microsoft Copilot Studio** from the search results to install the Microsoft Copilot Studio app in Teams. If you don't see Microsoft Copilot Studio in the results, your tenant might not yet be updated; instead search for and select **Power Virtual Agents**.

## Create a new copilot

To create a new copilot, follow these steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Copilot Studio for Teams app.

1. Select **Start now** under "Create a copilot".

1. Select the team to own and manage your copilot from the drop-down list and then select **Continue**.

    When you're creating a new copilot, team owners and the copilot creator have read/write access by default. Team members only have read access to the copilot.

    If this is your first time creating a copilot or Power Apps application in the team, you'll receive a notification that the process will be slightly longer than usual while the system sets up. Select **Close** to continue and then wait a few minutes for Teams to notify you that the copilot is ready. The notification that its set up and ready appears in **Activity**. Once you see it, select the message, then select **Next** to continue.

1. Provide a **Copilot name** and select the **Language** for copilot to speak. For this example, use **Event Contacts** for the name. You can also select an optional icon.

	> [!NOTE]
	> After you have set the copilot's language, it can't be changed.

1. Select **Create** to complete creating a new copilot.

From the Microsoft Copilot Studio editor, you can manage topics, edit and test your copilot, and then publish it to the rest of the team or the entire organization. Topics are how copilot conversations transpire and they're covered in the next section.
