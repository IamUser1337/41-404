The best way to monitor the status and diagnose the error of your chatbot is at the topic level.

The **Topics** list shows if the chatbot **Status** is on or off, if it has errors, and if it's currently being edited by someone.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Topics list with the chatbot status, errors, and editing values highlighted.](../media/topic-status-errors.svg)](../media/topic-status-errors.svg#lightbox)

Hover your mouse over the displayed initial to find the full name of the person who is editing the topic.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Mouse hovering the initial displayed under Editing that shows the full name of the person currently editing the topic.](../media/who-is-editing.svg)](../media/who-is-editing.svg#lightbox)

To diagnose the cause of the error, select the error in **Topics** to go to the **Setup** page, which shows that the error is from the authoring canvas.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Setup page where you can view the errors.](../media/error-status-authoring.svg)](../media/error-status-authoring.svg#lightbox)

Selecting the status error number will take you to the canvas, which shows the two errors in the **Topic checker** feature.
