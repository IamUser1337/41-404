## Scenario: Contoso Coffee customer support

> [!NOTE]
> The scenario has been kept simple for this learning path to help you understand the basics of Microsoft Power Automate and how it works with Microsoft Copilot Studio. These exercises have a simple requirement for you to retrieve data from a public weather service (MSN Weather) based on a region and by using a conditional statement within Microsoft Copilot Studio. This scenario will help showcase how you can use Power Automate to retrieve data from an external service.

Contoso Coffee is passionate about providing efficient, environmentally sustainable, and innovative coffee products, barista experiences, and services.

Consumer sentiment is at an all-time high, but with increasing competition, it's important to minimize costs and focus on customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the company can maintain its competitive edge in having a robust customer base while continuing to reinvest in the customer experience and maximize their customer lifetime value.

Contoso Coffee wants to provide customers with the ability to ask questions about their order status and delivery time and to modify their order and cancel it. This new initiative unlocks some capabilities for the call center staff and helps deflect common questions that are time-consuming on the phone, ensuring greater customer satisfaction and saving agents' time. They also briefly indicated that, in B2B scenarios where they often work with other manufacturers, they want those partners to be able to view and ask questions about latest invoices or payments or to escalate to live agents if they're in a specific tier of manufacturer.

Customer support costs continue to rise as the customer base grows, and the company can no longer continue to expand its customer support team. As a result, you're tasked with helping them find a solution by using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
