The primary advantage of a copilot is that they provide a personalized natural language conversation with the customer just as a human agent would. This allows copilots to handle common issues and frees up agents to focus on more complex issues. As they identify the intent of what the customer is saying, they can pivot and load content that is most relevant to them. Microsoft Copilot Studio uses topics to provide this content. By modifying a topic's conversation path, organizations can ensure that each customer is provided with a personalized and relevant experience. Information supplied by the customer throughout the conversation can be stored and used later as needed. Existing support content can be added as available topics.

We examined how organizations can create and manage Power Virtual Agent topics to provide tailored conversations to customers including:

- Examining how topics are used in Microsoft Copilot Studio to define how conversations between the copilot and customer flow.

- Reviewing the process to create topics and how to use the different conversation nodes to control and define different directions the customer can go down.

- Explaining how system topics are used by copilots.

- Examining how the system can suggest topics automatically based on existing documents such as knowledge articles or frequently asked questions.

- Explaining when and how you might use a system fallback topic to customize how your copilot handles scenarios where it doesn't recognize content.

- Reviewing the different options available for managing the different topics in your application.

From here, your next step would be to gain a deeper understanding on what tools are available to further enhance Microsoft Copilot Studios copilot capabilities. This would include items such as how to use Power Automate Flows, trigger hand offs to live agents, and deploy to different channels.
