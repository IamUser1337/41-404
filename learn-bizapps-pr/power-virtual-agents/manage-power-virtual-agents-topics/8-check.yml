  - content: You're creating a topic that provides the local weather forecast to a customer. Which conversation node would you use to launch a Power Automate flow to get forecast details from a weather service?
    choices:
    - content: Ask a question
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Conversation nodes are used by topics to help control the flow of a conversation. They're used to display messages, capture data, or if it's the call an action node, they can be used to launch a Power Automate flow that interacts with an external service.
    - content: Go to another topic
      isCorrect: false

  - content: Currently, when your bot is unable to identify which topic to present to a customer, it automatically escalates the conversation to a live agent. You've been asked to configure the bot to first ask the customer a few questions to determine if a topic can help before escalating the conversation. How is this done?
    choices:
    - content: Enable and configure the fallback topic
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Fallback topics can be enabled to defer a customer topic rather than triggering an escalation. Once you've enabled the fallback topic for your bot, you can configure the topic as you would any other topic in the system.
    - content: Enable and configure the escalate topic
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fallback topics can be enabled to defer a customer topic rather than triggering an escalation. Once you've enabled the fallback topic for your bot, you can configure the topic as you would any other topic in the system.
    - content: Enable and configure the routing topic
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fallback topics can be enabled to defer a customer topic rather than triggering an escalation. Once you've enabled the fallback topic for your bot, you can configure the topic as you would any other topic in the system.
    - content: Enable and configure entities
      isCorrect: false
