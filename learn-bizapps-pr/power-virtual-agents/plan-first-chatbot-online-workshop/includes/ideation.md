When implementing any business system or process, make sure that you begin by setting goals for your bot to ensure that youâ€™re providing business value. The **Bot Building Handbook** discusses these three core areas to consider:

- Delivery goals

- Business goals

- Chatbot governance

Focusing on some areas might be more imperative than others, depending on the organization's requirements. However, from a project perspective, all three areas have equal importance when you're aiming for success.

To set goals for your bot, complete the following steps:

1. Open Microsoft Word or another note-taking app.

1. Consider your project goals for building a bot. You can use your own company as an example, or you can use the Contoso Coffee fictional scenario that was previously outlined. Key questions to consider while developing your project goals are:

   - Do you have go-live target dates?

   - Have expectations been established around target use cases or questions that the bot should answer?

   - Are requirements in place about connecting with other systems, such as service ticket systems?

1. Examine your business goals, which you can track after the bot has been delivered and is live. Ask yourself the following questions regarding your business goals:

   - What internal business metrics do you want to improve as part of this project?

       - Does your organization want to provide self-service capabilities? If so, having a bot answer questions and the resolved session percentage might be a key metric to track.

       - Have expectations been established around the resolved session percentage? (Increasing this metric is a standard expectation.)

       - Does the business want to track the escalated session percentage? (Decreasing this metric is normally the goal over time.)

   - Who are the monthly active users for your bot experience (whether internal or external)?

1. Examine your application lifecycle management (ALM) goals that help with the ongoing management after the bot is initially deployed. Then, determine how to make improvements to the bot based on that data. Consider the following questions to help generate ideas:

   - Are goals established for application lifecycle management?

   - Does the company have an onboarding process for new chatbot authors?

   - How often would metrics be reviewed and how would that take place?
