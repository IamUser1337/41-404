This lab experience shows you the steps to build your bot in less than a day.

The labs in this module show you how to:

- Access Microsoft Copilot Studio.

- Create a new topic within Microsoft Copilot Studio.

- Use the latest authoring canvas to build your topic by using authoring tools, including questions, messages, variables, and Microsoft Power Fx.

- Make your chatbot more powerful by integrating Microsoft Power Automate and external data.

## Setup and prerequisites

Your instructor sets up a tenant with resources for you to use to work through these lab materials. Follow the instructions that your trainer provides for signing in before you start the labs.

### How to work through these materials without a trainer

If you're working through these materials independently without an instructor, you can sign up for a trial of Microsoft Copilot Studio with your work or school account by going to [https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com), where you can create the GA release Microsoft Copilot Studio bots and also the preview bots. Additionally, you can use the Microsoft 365 Developer Account and Microsoft Power Apps Developer Account to create tenants and services to sign up for a Microsoft Copilot Studio trial. For more information, see the [Signing up for a developer plan for Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/blog/signing-up-for-a-developer-plan-for-power-virtual-agents/?azure-portal=true) blog post.

## Set up and access

Ensure that you have access to the tenant that your instructor set up and that you can access Microsoft Copilot Studio. Go to [https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your provided credentials. Some first-run experiences might be offered within the application to help you when you're opening for the first time, and you can review these experiences before starting the rest of the labs.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working without an instructor, the steps in the first lab to set up your trial might be different.
