When considering which business processes to automate, you'll need to determine which have the highest traffic and could be completed in a chatbot without the need for human involvement. You don't want to replicate what your website can already do. Most customers are familiar with websites and can accomplish certain tasks themselves without needing to interact with a chatbot.

Consider asking yourself the following questions:

- Which areas could we improve customer interaction?

- Where do customers struggle to find answers to their questions?

- Does a more efficient way exist for completing a task?

- Are procedures or processes in place that would benefit from a virtual agent?

While examining those questions, you can start to identify scenarios where a chatbot would be beneficial, such as:

- **Process returns and exchange requests** - Instead of providing a customer with a list of steps to submit a return, as you would on a website, a chatbot could provide the customer with a guided experience that:

  - Initiates the return.

  - Provides a shipping label.

  - Offers suggestions on a possible replacement product.

- **Making reservations or booking tickets** - The chatbot could help the customer identify the date and time that they're looking for and how many people are in their party. It could book their reservation and send them a confirmation.

- **Paying a bill or processing a claim** - A chatbot can help the customer identify an outstanding balance and then go through the process of making a payment on the balance.

These examples are only a few of the many possible scenarios where a chatbot would be beneficial to a customer.

In addition to identifying what a bot does, you'll need to consider other factors, such as:

- **Data that the bot needs access to** - Determine if the bot will need to access customer data that's stored in another system. Assess how the information that the bot collects in the conversation will affect how your organization will interact with data in other sources.

- **Who consumes the bot** - Establish whether the bot will be used by employees, customers, or both. When considering the audience, you should also consider how they would access it.

    - **Internal audience** - Determine if the bot should be available in Microsoft Teams.

    - **Customers** - Decide what channels that the bot would be available in.

These considerations are important because they can affect how you design the bot and other factors.
