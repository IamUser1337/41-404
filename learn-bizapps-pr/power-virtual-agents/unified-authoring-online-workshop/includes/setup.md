In its latest release, Microsoft Copilot Studio has evolved the Copilot authoring experience to help make it easier and faster for you to give authors more tools when they're creating conversational experiences. As a result, more Microsoft Copilot Studio customers and virtual agents can have engaging conversations that meet the business goals.

In this lab, you'll build on a basic topic from the second lab in this learning path. You'll layer more experiences, where you can create directly in the app, starting with enhanced question behavior, working with entities, and using rich text options. This approach allows you to begin from a basic conversational experience from the second lab and then learn how you can use the latest features to further enhance your Copilot.

## Task: Create your custom topic 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're completing this lab from the Plan your first Copilot module, you should've already created everything. Review the following items, and if you already have your topic built in Microsoft Copilot Studio, you can skip this task.

In this task, you'll create your own custom topic. Then, you'll test and publish it to create a base for you to work with for the rest of this lab.

1.  Create a custom topic with a title and trigger phrases of your choice.

1.  Create a **Question** node within the authoring canvas in Microsoft Copilot Studio by using the **User's entire response** option to identify the response data.

1.  Create a **Message** node after the **Question** node.

1.  Add an **End conversation** node at the end of the flow.

1.  Save your topic and then test it by using the **Test your Copilot** option.

1.  Publish under the **Publish** site map option.

If you require guidance to complete the preceding tasks, see the Build your first Copilot module in this learning path, which covers the steps on how to create each item.
