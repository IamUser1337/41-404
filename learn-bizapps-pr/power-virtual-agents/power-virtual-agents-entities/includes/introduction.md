Microsoft Copilot Studio allows organizations to quickly create copilots based on business scenarios their customers and employees can easily interact with as needed. Items like topics can be easily created by subject matter experts with no coding required, to create intelligent conversation paths to help guide individuals down as they interact with the copilots. The copilot authoring functionality provided by Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a great starting point for organizations to build intelligent copilots.

One of the many benefits of Microsoft Copilot Studio is the fact that it allows individuals to communicate with copilots using natural language understanding.
This means that users can type as they would talk, and the copilot will understand and interact with them accordingly. Additionally, the copilot can capture the responses users provide along the way. For example, as a user engages with your copilot, you can capture and store information like their name or date of birth, so it can be easily used later in other parts of your copilot.

To assist with this, Microsoft Copilot Studio includes two features that can help you enhance and improve the overall experience of interacting with your copilot.

These features are:

-   **Entities:** An entity is an information unit that represents a certain type of a real-world subject, like a phone number, zip code, city, or even a person's name.

-   **Variables:** A variable is a piece of information captured and stored in a copilot so it can be used later.

Throughout the remainder of this module, we're going to examine the capabilities of working with Entities and Variables in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
