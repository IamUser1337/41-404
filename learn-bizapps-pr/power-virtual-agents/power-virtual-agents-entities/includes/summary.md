The primary advantage of a copilot is that they provide a personalized natural language conversation with the customer just as a human agent would. This allows copilots to handle common issues and will free up agents to focus on more complex issues. As copilots identify the intent of what the customer is saying, they can pivot and load subject matter that is most relevant to them. Microsoft Copilot Studio uses entities and variables to help provide tailored experiences. By creating entities, you can easily extract specific information from text entered by users. This information is stored in variables so it can be used elsewhere in the copilot.

In this module, we examined how organizations can create and manage entities and topics to provide tailored conversations to customers, including:

-   Examining what entities are and how they're used by Microsoft Copilot Studio.

-   Explaining how to create custom entities to extract and capture information unique to your organization.

-   Reviewing how to use the information captured in entities and store them in variables that can be used throughout your copilot.

-   Explaining the different types of variables available and when to use them.

From here, your next step would be to gain a deeper understanding on what tools are available to further enhance Microsoft Copilot Studio copilot capabilities. This would include items such as how to use Power Automate Flows, trigger hand offs to live agents, and deploy to different channels.
