When building a bot, you need to create topics, trigger phrases, and responses. This process can be time-consuming. Now, creating topics in Microsoft Copilot Studio is more effortless than before. You can create a topic in Microsoft Copilot Studio by using natural language to describe what you want the topic to do. Then, you can select **Create** for the Copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio feature to automatically build that topic, reducing the manual steps of creating a topic.

## Introduction to Conversation Booster

Conversation Booster is a new feature that allows you to improve your bot's responses. It allows your bot to find and present information from multiple sources (which might be internal or external) without requiring the creation of topics. You can use generative answers as primary information sources in your copilot or as fallback when authored topics are unable to address a user's query. As a result, you can quickly create and deploy a functional bot without needing to manually create multiple topics that might not address your customer's questions.
