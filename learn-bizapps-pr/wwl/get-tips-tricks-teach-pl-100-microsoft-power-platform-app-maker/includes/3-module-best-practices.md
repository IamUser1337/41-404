 
The PL-100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker course isn't a fundamentals course. While no coding experience is required, students build their skills to be able to utilize Microsoft Power Platform as a low code platform. 

Use the trainer demos and your own experience to demonstrate each learning path’s purpose and watch for links to additional information that you want to share with your students. In addition: 

- Be familiar with all of the parts that make up the Power Platform 

- There can be a lot of drag and drop to ensure the right steps in the right order  

- Ensure you understand security, hierarchy, teams, users, and data 

- Be familiar with solutions and environments 

Acquire a Power Platform trial tenant and access the Power Platform admin center prior to class using [Lab 00: Validate lab environment](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/PL-100-Microsoft-Power-Platform-App-Maker/Instructions/Labs/Lab00-Validate-lab-environment.html). 

Before you begin, make sure you use the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC). It is recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center (LDC)](https://aka.ms/ldc) at least quarterly. If you have not already done so, download the course materials from the LDC before continuing in this learning path.
