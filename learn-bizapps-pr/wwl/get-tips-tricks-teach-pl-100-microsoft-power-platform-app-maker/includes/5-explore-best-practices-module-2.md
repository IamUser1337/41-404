 
Learning Path 2 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about working with model-driven apps. 
Students will also learn about details for the different components of a model-driven app, like the UI component, logic components, the visualization and data component, and how to customize an app. 
Finally, since model-driven apps are built on Dataverse, this learning path extensively covers Dataverse and Dataverse security. 

This learning path consists of eight modules: 

- Module 1 – Introduction to model-driven apps and Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 2 – Get started with Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 3 – Get started with model-driven apps in Power Apps 

- Module 4 – Create and manage columns within a table in Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 5 – Get started with security roles in Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 6 – Document and test your Power Apps application 

- Module 7 – Get started with Microsoft Dataverse for Teams 

- Module 8 – Build your first app with Microsoft Dataverse for Teams

Learning Path 2 Tips and Tricks 

- Spend some time helping students understanding Dataverse and its core concepts 

- Focus on business-critical use cases and that many out of the box solutions do not meet exact business needs or integrate with other business programs 

- Provide hands-on experience in building a model-driven app and how to customize them.  

- Explain the difference between forms and views 

- Describe controls and how to make model-driven app views editable using editable grid control 

- Remind students that there will also be questions around security roles and access policies
