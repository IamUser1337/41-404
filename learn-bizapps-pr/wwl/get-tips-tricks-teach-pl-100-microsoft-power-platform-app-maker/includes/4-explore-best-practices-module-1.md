 
PL-100: Learning Path 1 Introduction to Microsoft Power Platform 

Learning Path 1 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path students are introduced to Power Platform and the different components, the business value for customers, and the security of the technology. 

This Learning Path consists of five modules: 

- Module 1 – What is Microsoft Power Platform? 

- Module 2 – Data Connectors 

- Module 3 – Pulling it all together 

- Module 4 – Get started with Power Apps 

- Module 5 – Power Apps related technologies

Learning Path 1 Tips and Tricks 

- Describe and clarify the Microsoft Dataverse (common data platform) 

- Explain low-code development environment with services, connectors, and a scalable data service and app platform 

- Describe the canvas app vs model-driven app differences (model-driven must use Dataverse while canvas can use any data source (Sharepoint, Access, etc.) 

- Discuss the concept of integration and interaction with existing data and how with Power Platform much of it's simplified 

- Some tips for showing demos in class: 

 - Be intentional in the way you move your mouse cursor. Moving too quickly might confuse your students. For example, if your cursor is on top of the button, wait 1-2 seconds before clicking. Then narrate the action (for example, “now I’m going to access the main menu and click on the ‘Dashboard’ button”). 

 - Call out every single action you're doing, for example “now I’m going to click here”. If you're typing something, explain why it's being done. Your demonstration might be the first encounter with the interface for your students and it's likely that they are going to be unfamiliar with it.
