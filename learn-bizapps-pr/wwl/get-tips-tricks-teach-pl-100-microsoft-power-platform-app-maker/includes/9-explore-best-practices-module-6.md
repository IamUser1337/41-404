PL-100: Learning Path 6 Get started with AI Builder 

Learning Path 6 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path students learn about AI Builder, the different AI models, and creating Power Virtual Agents (PVA) within Teams. Students also learn about the differences between a pre-built model and a custom model. They learn how to train a custom model and how to use a model within a Power App or Power Automate. 

This learning path consists of two modules: 

- Module 1 – Introduction to AI Builder 

- Module 2 – Create a chatbot with Power Virtual Agents and Dataverse for Teams
