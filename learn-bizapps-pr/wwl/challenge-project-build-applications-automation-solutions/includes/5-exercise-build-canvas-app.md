Compose a canvas app that is appropriate for scouts to use in the field.  Your proof of concept app needs to be functional and easy to use. Donâ€™t spend too much time on design at this stage.
- Show players.
- Allow to create or edit existing players.
- Allow to create new scouting reports and edit reports they created.
- Allow to add or edit contacts that are related to the player.
- Scouts shouldn't be able to edit a player record of a player who failed the drug test.

## Considerations
- Are you building an app that targets phone or tablet?

## Check your work
1. View your players in your canvas app. Validate that all of the players you have created while testing are shown. 
2. Open a player and edit a few columns. Create a new scouting report on the player.
3. On the same player row, change the drug test column to failed. Save the change and ensure that a scout cannot edit the player's row anymore.
