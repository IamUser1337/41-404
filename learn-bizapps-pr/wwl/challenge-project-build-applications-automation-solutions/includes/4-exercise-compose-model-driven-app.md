Create a model-driven app that is appropriate for office staff to use to complete their needed tasks.  Include navigation, tables, forms, views, and all the necessary components.
- Users should be able to create/edit new player records, create/edit contacts, and create/edit scout reports.

## Considerations
- Is the data model complete?  What accommodations did you have to make to complete the prior exercise?
- Does the data model lend itself to a good user experience?  How can you ensure user adoption with this data model?  What options are available with model-driven apps to give the app a good user experience?

## Check your work
1. Run your model-driven app. Create a new contact and validate your navigation in the app is behaving as expected.
2. Create a new player and validate that the behavior in the app is as expected.
3. Create a new scouting report on your new player.
