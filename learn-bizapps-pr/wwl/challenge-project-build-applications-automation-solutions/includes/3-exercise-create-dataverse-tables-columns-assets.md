### Forms and views

Build the appropriate forms and views for the data model youâ€™ve built 
to be used in the model driven app.

-   Decide what columns need to be on the forms and in what order,

-   Decide what columns do you need to add/remove from your views, consider what
    columns should be read-only,

-   Evaluate if you need to present related tables as subgrids.

-   Decide if you should edit the default forms and views, should you create new
    from existing forms and views, or should you create them from blank.

-   Enable column security for the **Drug test result** and **Last drug test**
    columns.

### Security roles

Create a security role that allows scouts to:

-   Create, edit players and contacts.

-   Edit their own scouting reports and create scouting reports.

Create a column security profile that allows scout managers to:

-   Read, update, and create permissions to the Last drug test and Drug test result columns.

## Check your work
1.	Open the Player table and create a new row by populating the First Name, Height, and Weight. Confirm that the Last Name is required to create a Player row. Populate the Last Name and save to create the Player.
2.	Open the form you created for the Scouting report. In the Player lookup, locate the Player you created in the previous step. 
3.	Open the security role you created for scouts. For scouting reports, validate that scouts have access to edit and create rows.
