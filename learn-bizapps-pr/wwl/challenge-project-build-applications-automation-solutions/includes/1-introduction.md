In this Challenge Project, you'll evaluate the requirements and build the solutions and automation as required.  Think of this task as building a functioning proof of concept. The data model has been designed for you, but the specifics of the apps are left to you to design. Make sure you design with users top of mind for a good experience that meets the stated requirements.

## Example scenario

You'll implement the data model provided in Microsoft Dataverse and create any necessary Power Apps and automation.  The data model is provided for you to implement as well as requirements for building and automating the Power Apps.

## What will we be doing?

- Composing a Power Apps model-driven app for office staff
- Building a Power Apps canvas app for scouts
- Automating with a cloud flow for reporting on players

## What is the main goal?
By the end of this challenge, you'll have a working solution that validates your knowledge of Microsoft Power Platform and how to use and configure it.
