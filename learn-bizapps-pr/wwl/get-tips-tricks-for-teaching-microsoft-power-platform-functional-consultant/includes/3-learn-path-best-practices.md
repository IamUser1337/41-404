 
The PL-200: Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant course is not a fundamentals course. Students build their skills to be able to define the functional capabilities of a modern application or solution utilizing the best low code platform from Microsoft, the Power Platform. 

Use the trainer demos and your own experience to demonstrate each learning path’s purpose and watch for links to additional information that you want to share with your students. In addition: 

- Be familiar with all of the parts that make up the Power Platform 

- There can be a lot of drag and drop to ensure the right steps in the right order  

- Ensure you understand security, hierarchy, teams, users, and data. 

- Be familiar with solutions and environments 

Make sure and add a Power Apps trial to the tenant and assign licenses to users prior to class using [Lab 0: Validate lab environment](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/PL-200-Power-Platform-Functional-Consultant/Instructions/Labs/LAB%5BPL-200%5D_M00L00_Validate_Lab_Environment.html).
