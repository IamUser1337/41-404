PL-200: Learning Path 9 Solutions and integrations 

Learning Path 9 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path students begin thinking about bringing consistent development strategies to their work and start to utilize integration with other technologies, be they Microsoft or third-party solution providers. 

This learning path consists of two modules: 

Module 1 – Application Lifecycle Management 

Module 2 – Interoperability with other services

Learning Path 9 Tips and Tricks 

- Review [What is Power Pages? | Microsoft Learn](/power-pages/introduction) with participants to confirm that the connection to other Power Platform or even Dynamics capabilities is understood 

- Explain that Power Pages are not portals and demonstrate that  

- Describe what application lifecycle can bring to consistency and efficiency in successful development 

- Discuss a successful environment approach for application/solution deployment (for example DEV/TST/PROD) and successful environment approaches that may include solution, business group, or organization structures  

- Explain managed and unmanaged environments and solution deployment for business as usual 

- Describe environment variables and remind students about the parts that are not part of a solution like Power BI (use DEVOPS)
