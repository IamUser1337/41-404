PL-200: Learning Path 8 Visualize data with Power BI 

Learning Path 8 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path students learn the use of Power BI within Power Platform, not for its wider use. This learning path does not cover how to build Power BI reports and dashboards. These topics are covered by the PL-300 course that is specific for Power BI. 

This learning path consists of two modules: 

Module 1 – Introduction to analyzing data with Power BI 

Module 2 – Consume Power BI in Power Platform

- Explain how the second ‘module’ dives more into Power Platform and Power BI integration 

- Encourage students to change the data in Dataverse to see the impact in Power BI 

- Reiterate the integration between apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, and Power BI
