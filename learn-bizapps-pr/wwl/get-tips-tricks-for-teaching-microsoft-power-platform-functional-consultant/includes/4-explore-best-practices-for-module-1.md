PL-200: Learning Path 1 Work with Microsoft Dataverse 

Learning Path 1 Overview 

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path, students learn about the Microsoft Dataverse and some of the basics of the Power Platform, environments, and the Power Platform feature called solutions. 

This Learning Path consists of eight modules: 

- Module 1 – What is a relational database? 

- Module 2 – Introduction to Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 3 – Manage environments 

- Module 4 – Manage customizations with solutions 

- Module 5 – Create and manage tables in Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 6 – Create and manage columns in Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 7 – Create relationships between tables in Microsoft Dataverse 

- Module 8 – Create and define calculated and rollup columns in Microsoft Dataverse

Learning Path 1 Tips and Tricks 

- Explain data modeling techniques and why the Dataverse allows all to develop a data strategy  

- Describe the Common Data Model that deploys standard industry table structures 

- Illustrate how Microsoft Dataverse is more than just a set of tables, describe what’s in the box, the benefits, and that it's easy use 

- Consider doing some basic demos using the first labs to help the students understand environments in the Power Platform, and discuss the default environment and how it should be kept for personal development and apps 

- Some tips for showing demos in class: 

	- Be intentional in the way you move your mouse cursor. Moving too quickly might confuse your students. For example, if your cursor is on top of the button, wait 1-2 seconds before clicking. Then narrate the action, for example “now I’m going to access the main menu and click on the ‘Dashboard’ button”. 

	- Call out every single action you're doing, for example “now I’m going to click here”. If you're typing something, explain why it's being done. Your demonstration might be the first encounter with the interface for your students and it's likely that they're going to be unfamiliar with it.
