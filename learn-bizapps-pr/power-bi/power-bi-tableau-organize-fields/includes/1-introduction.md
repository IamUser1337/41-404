The goal of this module is to explain how to prepare your datasets properly for future development and analysis, whether it's for the developers that you're handing information to, or for the end users who are going to get their hands dirty. 

By understanding how to organize and simplify your calculations, you can visualize data faster and more efficiently. On top of that, this module will help you create an organizational structure for Power BI, one that should be familiar coming from Tableau.
