    choices:
    - content: The `buttonClicked` event
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The app raises the `buttonClicked` event when a user selects a Power BI report button.
    - content: The `commandTriggered` event
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The app raises the `commandTriggered` event when a user selects a command from a context menu.
    - content: The `dataSelected` event
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The app raises the `dataSelected` event when a user selects an element of a visual, such as a region of a map.
    - content: The `visualClicked` event
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The app raises the `visualClicked` event when a user selects a visual.
  - content: Phoebe is a developer at Tailspin Toys who wants to allow users to store a specific Power BI report page state, including filters. Users should be able to reapply that state again within the same report session. Which client API operation should Phoebe use to store the report page state?
    choices:
    - content: Add report filters
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Adding report filters doesn't capture a specific report page state. Instead, it filters the entire report.
    - content: Apply the bookmark state
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying the bookmark state doesn't capture a specific report page state. Instead, it overwrites the report page state with the bookmark state.
    - content: Apply a custom layout
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying a custom layout doesn't capture a specific report page state. Instead, it changes the report page layout.
    - content: Capture the bookmark state
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Capturing the bookmark state stores a specific report page state so that the user can reapply it later.
  - content: Itzik is a developer at Tailspin Toys who wants to allow users to personalize visuals. Which client API function should Itzik's app use?
    choices:
    - content: The `applyTheme` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `applyTheme` function applies a new theme to the report page. It can't personalize a visual.
    - content: The `customLayout` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `customLayout` function applies a new layout to the report page. It can't personalize a visual.
    - content: The `createVisual` function
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `createVisual` function adds a new visual with a default layout to the authoring page.
    - content: The `updateSettings` function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `updateSettings` function applies new settings to an embedded artifact. It can't personalize a visual.
