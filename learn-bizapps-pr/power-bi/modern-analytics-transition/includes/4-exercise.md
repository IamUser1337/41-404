In this task, you'll launch Power Query from Power BI Desktop and edit the existing queries to add a new Dates table.

1. From the **Home** ribbon, select **Transform data** > **Transform data** option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This will launch Power Query from Power BI Desktop. It looks very similar to Power Query in Excel and both the Customers and Quotes queries have been imported with their transformation.
	
    :::image type="content" source="../media/queries.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Query Editor with the Customers and Quotes queries after import.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may see a file location error message:

    > Details:
    > C:\MAIAD\Attendee\Lab Materials\Lab 02A\MAIAD Lab 02A - Data Source - Customers.csv
    > 
    > Youâ€™ll need to select each query from the Queries pane > then in the Applied Steps of the Query Settings pane, select the Source step > and then select the Gear icon to the right of the Source step and update the file path location, as applicable.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/source-fixes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Query editor where Source paths are being modified to correct the aforementioned error.":::

### Task 2: New Source - Add a dates table

In this task, you'll add a Dates table to the existing Queries, and Load that new query and table to the Data Model.

1. From the Power Query Editor **Home** ribbon, select **Get data** > **Text/CSV** option.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/text-cvs-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Query Editor displaying Home > Get Data > Text/CVS option.":::

1. Navigate to the **C:\modern-analyst-labs\Lab 02A** folder.

1. Select the file **MAIAD Lab 02A - Data Source - Dates.csv** and choose **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/open-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Open window with MAIAD Lab 02A - data Source - Dates.csv selected.":::

1. If displayed, accept the default File Origin, Delimiter, and Data Type Detection options. Then select the **OK** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/power-query-editor-csv-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Query Editor CSV File origin, Delimiter, and Data Type Detection window displayed.":::

### Task 3: Rename query

In this task, you'll add a rename the Query to use a user-friendly noun name versus the default file name.

1. **Double-click** in the Queries Pane on **"MAIAD Lab 02A - Data Source - Dates"** to rename the default Query name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Column data types drive different functionality in Power BI, for example, a Whole Number will default to aggregate. It wouldn't make sense to SUM the \[Year\] column, so by changing to a Text data type, we prevent this default aggregation.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/dates-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power Query Editor with Dates table and the Year column data types displayed.":::

1. Select the **Replace current** button from the Change Column Type window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since we are on the Change Type step in the Applied Steps, this message confirms that we want to change the \[Year\] to the Text data type in this existing step. The **Add new step** option would change the \[Year\] to the Text data type but add that as a *new* step in the Applied Steps list.

## Exercise 3: Close Power Query & load dates table to the data model

In this exercise, you'll Close & Apply the Power Query Editor changes, and Load the Dates table to the Data Model.

### Task 1: Close & Apply

In this task, you'll use the Close & Apply button to save the Dates query in the Power Query Editor and Load the Dates table to the Data Model.

- From the Power Query Editor **Home** ribbon, select **Close & Apply** button > **Close & Apply** option to load the new Dates table to the Data Model.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you started with an existing Excel file that contained Power Query data connections to an Excel and CSV file from the previous Lab. You launched the Power BI Desktop application and imported the existing Power Connections from Excel to Power BI Desktop and saved them as a PBIX file. Then you used the Transform data button to launch the Power Query Editor from within Power BI Desktop to load a new Dates query from a CSV data source, and then used the Preview area to perform a data type transformation of the \[Year\] column. Lastly, you used the Close & Apply option to add the Dates query as a new table to the Data Model.
