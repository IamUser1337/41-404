  Developers can programmatically embed Power BI analytics items in their apps to present data as in-context visualizations. Users can then make decisions based on facts instead of opinions.

  Any type of Microsoft Power BI content can be embedded into an app: Power BI reports, Power BI report visuals, paginated reports, dashboards, specific dashboard tiles, and even the Q&A natural language experience.

  Moreover, real-time Power BI content will show up-to-date results in an embedding app. Developers can integrate content with the app in many different ways to provide a seamless experience. They can even brand Power BI as their own.

  Usually, embedding requires a programmatic solution, but this module also describes no-code embedding approaches that could be suited to simpler requirements.

  > [!TIP]
  > Power BI is in a constant state of evolution, so be sure that you keep abreast of new features that are announced in the <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog" target="_blank">Microsoft Power BI Blog</a>. You might discover new features and capabilities that you can apply to improve your existing reports.
