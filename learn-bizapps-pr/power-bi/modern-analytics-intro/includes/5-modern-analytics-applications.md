It's best to keep your Microsoft modern analytics applications current and up to date. We recommend that you use the 64-bit version of Office 365/Excel 2016+ to provide the best experience.

We also recommend that you use a 64-bit version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop, which you can download from the Microsoft Store. Power BI Desktop has new features and capabilities that are released monthly. Therefore, we recommend that you always use the most recent monthly version release of the application.

Microsoft Power BI Desktop is free to download and use, but if you want to create, publish, and share datasets, reports, or a dashboard to Power BI service, then you need a Power BI Pro, Power BI Premium, or Power BI Premium Per User license.
