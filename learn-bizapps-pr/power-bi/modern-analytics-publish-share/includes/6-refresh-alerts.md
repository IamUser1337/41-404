A Power BI developer can decide when and how often data refreshes. The refresh process can be up to eight times each day with a Pro license, up to 48 times each day with Premium, and up to six datasets simultaneously. Scheduled refreshes automatically keep your data up to date by using Power BI Gateway.

You can limit what data is refreshed when you connect to relational database sources, such as Azure, SQL Server, and Oracle. It's possible to configure only new data to be refreshed and how much to store.

A developer can set up email alerts in the Power BI service if a refresh fails or to trigger a flow from Microsoft Power Automate.
