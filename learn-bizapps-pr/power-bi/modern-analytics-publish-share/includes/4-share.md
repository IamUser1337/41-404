A person who uses a free Power BI account can only publish reports to **My workspace**, which is a private workspace that can't be shared with other users. Reports that are published to **My workspace** can't be accessed by other users except through a public web embed link.

- To publish a report to any other workspace, the user needs a Power BI Pro or Power BI Premium license. Users need to have a Power BI Pro license to view the report or the report needs to be published to a Power BI Premium workspace.
- To create scorecards with goals, the workspace needs to be a premium workspace. Only users with Power BI Premium can create Premium workspaces.
- Power BI Premium comes in two licensing forms: per user and per capacity.

## Share settings

You can share an individual report with specific people or with Microsoft Office 365 groups. The publisher needs to configure access rules by going into the **Settings** menu in the report in the Power BI service.

As publisher, you can configure settings that enable report users to do any of the following activities:

- Build new reports with the dataset.
- Share a report with others.
- Allow users to change filter types.
- Allow users to add comments to the report.

## Comments

People can interact with each other within the report in the Power BI service. People can create comments on a page, specific visual, or dashboard tile. Commenting is similar to other documents across Office 365. Using *\@mention* behaves the same way and sends a notification to the person.

## Personal bookmarks

Bookmarks can be personalized. A Power BI developer can also make bookmarks that everyone can use. This feature facilitates storytelling with the report.

To create bookmarks in Power BI Desktop:

1. From the ribbon, select **View** > **Bookmarks**.
1. Set the filters and slicers the way that you want them.
1. Select **Bookmarks** > **Add**.

Select this bookmark later to reset the page to that layout.
