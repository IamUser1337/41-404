Microsoft Power BI offers flexibility with security when you're sharing data across an organization. You can set up roles for specific individuals or groups to limit access to reports or specific data within a data model. Workspaces allow incremental refresh schedules with alerts to notify users when the dataset refreshes. Additionally, users can save specific views of the report by using bookmarks without having to reconfigure all filters when revisiting the report.

In the Power BI service, your reports exist within workspaces. Initially, when you create a workspace, only you have access. You can manage your workspace access restrictions through the **Manage access** button in the workspace view. Workspaces have four roles:

- **Viewer**. Can only view and read reports.
- **Contributor**. Publish reports to the workspace. Copy, edit, delete, and update dashboards within the workspace.
- **Member**. Add new contributors and viewers to the workspace and manage dataset permissions.
- **Admin**. Add or remove people and modify or delete the workspace.

For more information, see the workspace roles documentation link provided in the Summary unit of this module.

## Introduction to Power BI Goals

A unique feature of the Power BI service is that users can create and share scorecards within a workspace to host goals. Goals connect to a specific datapoint within a report and track the value of that datapoint at each refresh. The user specifies a target value for comparison. A scorecard allows the user to view many goals at once and observe where they currently stand and how they have progressed.
