    - content: The `groupID` and `embedUrl` properties.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. An app can't embed a Power BI report by using the `groupID` property, which is the unique identifier for a workspace.
    - content: The `reportID` and `embedUrl` properties.

  - content: Stanley is a developer at Tailspin Toys who needs to embed a Power BI report in an app. The report can connect to one of many datasets, each with the same schema but, which stores data for a different geographic region. Which property of the configuration object should Stanley set to connect to a certain dataset?
    choices: 
    - content: The `datasetBinding` property.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The `datasetBinding` property connects an embedded report to a different dataset.
