Automating your Power BI solution is useful when you need to reproduce management operations, such as during the onboarding process of new tenants (customers) in a multi-tenancy solution.

Operations can include the setup of Azure AD security objects, the creation of Power BI workspaces and content, and the management of Power BI capacities.

A well-designed automation solution should result in faster and more accurate management.
