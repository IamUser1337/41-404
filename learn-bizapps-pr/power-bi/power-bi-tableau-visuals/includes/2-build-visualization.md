As a Tableau analyst, creating a visual started with:

1. Selecting the fields you would like to visualize.

1. Next, dragging the fields to the Columns or Rows shelf.

1. Finally, you would refine the visual by adjusting the Marks card.

   Or with the **Show Me** dropdown.

In Microsoft Power BI, there are different steps to the same visualization process:

1. Start with the visual you're interested in by selecting one from the Visualization pane, like the "Show Me" feature in Tableau.

1. Next, you select the data you would like to visualize, like the Rows/Columns shelves in Tableau.

1. Lastly, refine the visual by adjusting the formatting, like the Marks Cards in Tableau.

It's often easiest to start with the visual because each visual contains different options. The visual itself guides what fields can be used and the subsequent formatting options.
