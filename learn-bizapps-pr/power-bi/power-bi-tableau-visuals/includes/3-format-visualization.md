There are two ways to adjust formatting: holistically or by visual. You can change the standard formatting for all the visuals you include by adjusting your theme. To adjust all visuals, pick a standard theme and make your preferred changes. This process resembles working with themes in PowerPoint or Word.

You can even ingest a custom JSON theme. This option might sound intimidating if you haven't coded in JSON. There are tools out there that make this process easy by giving you a template to fill out, or they allow you to make selections and then providing the relevant code.

Unless you're setting a theme, all other options fall under one section in Power BI. If you need to change the formatting on a visual, there's only one place to go.

This situation is a nice departure from other tools where formatting is spread over multiple panes and in different areas of the product. There are a wide variety of formatting options, some dependent on the type of visual you choose.

For example, a scatter plot has more options around visual shapes, sizes, and colors than a bar chart because you're encoding more fields in a scatter plot.

Power BI also offers conditional formatting and Tooltips, Learn about these features in the upcoming units.
