As with any other visual, you can interact with the visuals on the **Quick Insights** page. You can also pin any of them to a dashboard or filter to uncover more insights.

With **Quick Insights**, you can let Power BI do the work to spot outliers and trends in your data. Use those findings in your dashboards or continue to refine and filter to get to the insights that you need.
