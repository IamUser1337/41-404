To add your own questions, open a workspace and select the ellipsis next to the dataset that you want to use. Select **Settings** from the menu. You can completely disable the Q&A search input box from the **Dashboards** section of the **Settings** page.

When anyone selects the search input box, they see your suggested entries at the top of the prompt list. Custom questions are a valuable way to get dashboard users to think about the type of data that is available and how to best use it.
