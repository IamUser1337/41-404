Power BI reports help you find data, collect it in a data model, and build reports and visualizations. These features are even more powerful when you share your insights with others in your organization.

To share a dashboard, open it in the Power BI service and select the **Share** link in the top left-hand corner.

The link opens the **Share dashboard** page. In the **Enter a name or email address** field, enter the names of people whom you'd like to grant access to your dashboard. You can also copy and paste email addresses into this field, or you can use a distribution list, security group, or Microsoft 365 group.

If you select the **Send an email notification** check box, your recipients receive an email with a link to the shared dashboard. You can add an optional message to the email.

> [!NOTE]
> Recipients without an existing Power BI account will be taken through the sign-up process before viewing your dashboard.

Anyone whom you share a dashboard with can see and interact with it exactly as you do. However, they have read-only access to the underlying reports, and get access to the entire underlying dataset unless row-level security (RLS) is applied to the underlying dataset.
