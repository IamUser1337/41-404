Microsoft Power BI offers a set of mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices. These mobile apps let you connect to and interact with your cloud and on-premises data when you're on the go, anytime, anywhere. All the reports, dashboards, and apps you have available, either in the cloud in the Power BI service or on-premises on Power BI Report Server, are there.

The mobile apps provide most of the capabilities you have in the Power BI service for viewing, analyzing, and interacting with your data. The capabilities include cross-highlighting, cross-report drillthrough, and filtering. In addition, the mobile apps allow you to:
* View your data offline.
* Filter reports according to your geographic location.
* Scan barcodes on site to get directly to filtered data.
* Have your report start playing as a slideshow automatically whenever the app is launched (Windows app).

The goal of this module is to introduce some of the main capabilities of the mobile apps and explain how they work. You're encouraged to install the app on your device and follow along with your own reports as you explore the capabilities.
