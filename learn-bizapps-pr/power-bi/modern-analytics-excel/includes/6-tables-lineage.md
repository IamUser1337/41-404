Power BI offers you the ability to highlight which tables from the dataset should be featured connection options within Excel. In Power BI's **Model View**, you can select one of your tables and review the **Properties** pane. Tables include a toggle setting you can use to make them featured tables. You need to update the key column section to be a column with unique values and add more details for the user to learn about the table contents.

After updating all featured tables that you want included, save and publish the report to Power BI service.

## Featured tables - end user

The Power BI report author can highlight specific tables from the dataset, and the end user can pull data from these tables directly. You can locate these tables by going to the **Data** tab and selecting the **Data Types** section.

## Lineage

Anyone who has access to the workspace is able to view the dataset's lineage. If you select the ellipsis (**...**) at the end of the toolbar of a Power BI report, you can change to the lineage view.

This visual is an excellent way to show how dataflows, datasets, reports, and dashboards flow together within a workspace. Additionally, each report has more available options, such as **Analyze in Excel** or **View Usage Metrics**.

## Featured tables and data types

You can also use featured tables constructed in Power BI to convert individual data items in Excel into data types. These data types provide yet another avenue by which Power BI datasets can enhance and improve data functionality within Excel.
