Excel is a great application by itself. However, when you use Excel together with Power BI, it becomes even better. Not every report or analysis needs to be in Power BI, and you don't have to choose one and exclude the other. Excel will inherit all of Power BI's sensitivity, certified, and promoted labels, so you can work with confidence that your data is accessible only to authorized users.
