The ability to find and interact with Microsoft Dataverse data is a central benefit of implementing a Power Pages website. Lists, forms, and multistep forms are configurable to enable access to Dataverse data on websites and turn content websites into fully functional web apps. They're configurable and extendable to satisfy the most demanding business requirements.

In this module, you learned about the available Power Pages components that can help you find and interact with Dataverse data on the website. Additionally, you learned about the various features of the Power Pages components and how to complete the following tasks:

- Use Power Pages design studio to create lists and forms.

- Set up a form and multistep form metadata to access individual rows.

- Display a list of data and an associated drill-down list for details.

- Plan and set up a multistep form to implement a business process on a website.

- Trigger classic Dataverse workflows from the website.

## Next steps

The next step in exploring the website's capabilities is to study the inner workings of web templates and advanced Liquid constructs that can help in building robust and flexible webpages.
