In this self-paced module, you'll learn how to design Microsoft Power Apps cards and share the cards in Microsoft Teams.

## Overview

As an alternative to creating an app, you can create Power Apps cards for scenarios that require minimal user input, and you can share these cards by using Teams.

Cards require minimal code and development, but you can still connect with enterprise data and apply business logic by using Microsoft Power Fx scripts.

Some use cases for these micro apps include:

- Gathering a list of idea submissions.

- Running a poll on a topic that's specific to a team.

- Offering a quick-view presentation in Teams for a new record that's created in Microsoft Dataverse.

- Providing a review and approval process for invoices.

## Limitations

To determine whether a Power Apps card can address a scenario, you should consider the following limitations:

- **Data source** - You can only update Dataverse records; no creation or deletion is permitted.

- **Power Fx** - Only a limited set of expressions are available for cards, such as **Set** and **Collect**.

- **Sharing** - You can share cards only in a Teams channel or chat.

If you encounter these card limitation scenarios, consider creating a Power Apps canvas app.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned about potential use cases for Power Apps cards, you can learn how to design cards by using Power Apps Studio.
