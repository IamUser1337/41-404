AI Builder entity extraction provides organizations with a classification of documents and messages that's based on a predetermined series of topics, such as email, a person's name, and the temperature. Multiple businesses can benefit from this classification to automate routing of those messages. The following topics highlight a few example scenarios.

## First scenario - Contact us processing

A bicycle retailer has deployed an online store that generates visits and sales nationwide. Recently, the retailer had to manage a peak in the **Contact Us** form that the visitors on the website complete and that's sent to the general customer service group.

The service group is segmented by region to provide localized responses to the customers. Most **Contact Us** form messages contain information that could help you route the messages to the local segment.

Entity extraction will help you identify information, such as city, state, phone number, and street address, and then set rules to forward the messages to the customer service queues for these areas.

## Second scenario - Financial questions or information

A law firm wants to monitor a central email address that the firm uses in most of its documents and presentations. If any question relates to invoicing, rates, or has financial context, those email messages will be forwarded to the financial administrative group.

By processing the email messages with entity extraction and identifying emails that contain monetary amounts, you can send the targeted messages to the finance group.

## Third scenario - Organization names

A professional service group receives inquiries from customers and prospects in their sales-dedicated email address. Those messages are routed as opportunities to review by the sales team.

One sales manager notices that, in most email messages, the name of the organization is included. The manager wants the sales team to gain efficiency so has forwarded the messages to sales representatives who are dedicated to existing accounts when those messages relate to such accounts.

By processing the email messages with entity extraction and identifying if an organization is extracted from it, you'll enable an automated process that will assign the messages to the sales representatives when that organization is under their management.

Now that you've learned how to resolve different scenarios by using AI Builder entity extraction, you'll learn how to use this model in Microsoft Power Automate.
