In a digitally driven era, the volume of documents, emails, and other types of messages that an organization must process can be overwhelming.

Automating how and where those messages are routed, such as a customer care department, finance group, or marketing team, can help you achieve more efficiency.

AI Builder entity extraction provides this potential by helping you identify key elements from the text of those messages or documents and then classifying them into predefined categories.

In this unit, you'll learn how the AI Builder entity extraction feature can process unstructured messages into structured data that you can use to automate routing.
