  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.
  questions:
  - content: You want to create an Excel spreadsheet that contains the list of contacts that you manage in Dataverse. You select the **Edit data in Excel** option from the Contact table in the Power Apps portal to generate the file. The option to publish the changes back to Dataverse isn't available in Excel when you edit the file. What could cause this situation?
    choices:
    - content: The valid option for this scenario is to select **Dynamic Worksheet** from a view of the Contact table.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. **Dynamics Worksheet** isn’t the valid option for this scenario.
    - content: The **Microsoft PowerApps Office Add-in** isn't activated in Excel for this user.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Microsoft PowerApps Office Add-in must be activated for users to directly publish changes to Dataverse.
    - content: Edit data in Excel is available from model-driven apps only, not from the Power Apps portal.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. **Edit data in Excel** is available in the Power Apps portal.
  - content: You receive a request to generate an Excel spreadsheet with the list of accounts that your organization partners with. This file must be shared with a service provider outside your organization that doesn’t have an account in your Dataverse environment. Two weeks after supplying the file, you receive a request asking that they have permission to update the list of accounts based on recent changes in Dataverse. How should you proceed?
    choices:
    - content: Provide instructions to the service provider on how to use the **Refresh All** option in Excel.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. **Refresh All** won't update the records in Excel based on the changes in Dataverse for this scenario.
    - content: Provide a new file that’s been generated by using the **Dynamic Worksheet** export option in your model-driven app.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The service provider doesn't have a user account in your Dataverse environment and won't be able to refresh the list of records in Excel.
    - content: Provide a new file that’s been generated by using the **Static Worksheet** export option in your model-driven app.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A new and updated **Static Worksheet** is required to provide an updated list of contacts to the service provider for this scenario.
  - content: You create a **Dynamic PivotTable** file based on the sales forecast for your organization. After working different what-if scenarios and updating some of the values in the file, you try to import the file back in Dataverse by using the **Import from Excel** option of the related model-driven app. The import process fails and generates an error, which doesn’t allow you to import the modifications back in the sales forecast table. What could cause this situation?
    choices:
    - content: Exported files that are based on the **Dynamic PivotTable** option aren't in a valid format for the **Import from Excel** option.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Because the three required hidden columns aren't part of the generated file, the **Import from Excel** option will generate an error message stating that this format isn't supported.
    - content: The updated file must be imported by using the **Import PivotTable** option that’s available in the model-driven apps.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. No option such as **Import PivotTable** is available in model-driven apps.
    - content: The sales forecast values have been modified in Dataverse after the file was exported to Excel.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This statement could be valid if the export option had been different than **Dynamic PivotTable**.
