  - content: If a team deploys a new unmanaged solution with each sprint, in which sprint will this method work best?
    choices: 
    - content: Sprint 1
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The processes are clean at first. After more sprints, production will begin to break down due to hundreds of solutions.
    - content: Sprint 2
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. After several sprints, you’ll start to have a breakdown in production where a clear benefit for the logical separation between solutions is no longer present.
    - content: Sprint N + 1
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. After several sprints, you’ll start to have a breakdown in production where a clear benefit for the logical separation between solutions is no longer present.
    - content: Sprint N+ 2 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. After several sprints, you’ll start to have a breakdown in production where a clear benefit for the logical separation between solutions is no longer present.
