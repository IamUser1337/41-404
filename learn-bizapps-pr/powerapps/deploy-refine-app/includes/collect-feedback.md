Solution architects enjoy implementing apps that are adopted and used by the people for whom they were intended. However, tracking what people are using within these apps can be challenging. You can connect apps with Application Insights, a feature of Microsoft Azure Monitor. Application Insights includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and understand what users actually do with your app.

With your app connected to Applications Insights, you can collect information to help you drive better business decisions and improve the quality of your apps.
