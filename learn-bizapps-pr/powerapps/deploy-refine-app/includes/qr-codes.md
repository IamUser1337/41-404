With the **Barcode scanner** control in Power Apps, you can use your mobile phone or device to scan a barcode from [various formats](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-new-barcode-scanner#barcode-availability-by-device/?azure-portal=true).

## Prerequisites

Before adding the ability to scan barcodes and QR codes, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Make sure that you have a [Power Apps license](/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus/?azure-portal=true).

- Before you create a new app, you'll need to become familiar with Power Apps basics by [generating an app](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/get-started-test-drive/?azure-portal=true) and then customizing that app's [controls](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls/?azure-portal=true), [gallery](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-gallery/?azure-portal=true), [forms](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-forms/?azure-portal=true), and [cards](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-cards/?azure-portal=true).

- To create an app, make sure that you've been assigned to the [Environment Maker](/power-platform/admin/database-security/?azure-portal=true) security role.
