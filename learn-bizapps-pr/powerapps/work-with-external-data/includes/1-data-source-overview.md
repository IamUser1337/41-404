Data, the lifeblood of your apps, resides within a *data source* standing by for your commands. By establishing a *connection*, you seamlessly bridge the gap between your app and the data that brings it to life. Each connection employs a specific *connector*, acting as a conduit that opens the gateway to your desired data. Power Apps boasts an extensive array of connectors, including renowned powerhouses like SharePoint, SQL Server, Salesforce, and even Twitter—allowing you to tap into a vast array of both online and on-premises data sources.

Prepare to be amazed, for connectors are more than mere gatekeepers; they hold the key to a treasure trove of possibilities. Some connectors present you with **tables**, brimming with tabular data, while others unlock the power of **actions**, granting you the ability to interact with data in unique and exciting ways. What's more, some connectors go above and beyond, offering a delightful combination of both tables and actions. You can even dive deeper into the realm of customization by creating your own connectors tailored to your specific needs—an endeavor that brings an extra touch of technical prowess to your app-building journey.

## Tables

*Tables*, those magnificent vessels of tabular wisdom, are the backbone of connectors that provide tabular data. Within your app, you have the power to display, interact with, and manipulate complete tables, filtered tables, individual records, or even specific fields within those records. The possibilities are endless, and all the data within the table is at your fingertips. Once you establish a connection to a data source, you can seamlessly bring in one or more tables, selecting precisely what you need to fuel your app's functionality.

## Actions

*Actions*, on the other hand, open a portal to an exhilarating world of dynamic data retrieval. Connectors offering actions operate similarly to their table-based counterparts during the initial connection phase. However, instead of selecting specific tables, you wield the power to call upon actions, requesting data based on the specific action you invoke within the formula of a particular control. It's a manual dance, choreographed by you, allowing you to meticulously curate the data that flows into your app. Marvel at the possibilities as you explore action connectors like Yammer and Office 365 Outlook, where every interaction becomes an opportunity to shape your app's destiny.
