A standard practice in any software development is to not update or modify production systems directly. In Microsoft Power Platform, you would typically complete configuration and customization tasks on a developer environment and then transport the production systems to test, staging, and production environments by using a container called **Solutions**. These containers are used across the Power Platform, and can hold a wide variety of items. 

In this module, you'll load the Microsoft Power Apps in a Day solution configuration, run the Machine order app to generate sample data to work with, and then set up your solution to contain all your Microsoft Power Pages configuration.
