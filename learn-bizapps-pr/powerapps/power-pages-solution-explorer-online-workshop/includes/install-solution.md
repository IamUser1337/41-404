You can use a solution to transport components between environments. The solution that you're about to install is the completed solution from the standard [App in a Day course](https://aka.ms/appinaday/?azure-portal=true). The labs that are listed in this course continue building the functionality for apps that are built during the App in a Day course.

For more information, see [Solutions in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-overview/?azure-portal=true).

1. Locate theâ€¯solution .zip file that contains the name **StudentImport.zip** within the student files you've downloaded (1.Dev Resources and Solution Packages > ALM > PP IAD - Student > StudentImport). Do not unzip this file. Download the [student files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/power-pages/PowerPagesIADSupplierPortalStudent.zip) if you do not have them.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Unzipped solutions are not accepted by the Solution Importer. If you receive an error saying that you are missing the appropriate root file, then you have uploaded the wrong folder.
