  - content: You have a requirement to set a default value for a column on a form and also hide the column. What is the most efficient method to complete the task?
    choices: 
    - content: Use business rules on the model-driven form.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Business rules on the model-driven form won't apply to the website. A JavaScript function would work, but it isn't the most efficient method. Hiding the column on the form designer won't set the default value. A Table Form Metadata record has the ability to set a default value and hide the column by using the CSS class value of "hide".
    - content: Create a JavaScript function.

  - content: You need to apply different background color to all pages in the `/products` section of your Power Pages website. How would you accomplish this task? 
    choices: 
    - content: Add JavaScript to the website that would use the page URL to dynamically modify page styles.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: JavaScript isn't required for style changes. A CSS Web File applies styles to the parent page and all pages below in the hierarchy. Editing every page in the section isn't a sustainable approach. You can apply styles to individual pages and entire sections of a website.
