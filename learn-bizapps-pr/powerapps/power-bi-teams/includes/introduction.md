This lab has three exercises where you'll learn how to connect Microsoft Power BI to Microsoft Dataverse. You'll use Power BI Desktop to apply transformations to the data and to optimize it for reporting. Then, you'll publish your report to a workspace in Teams, where you'll build out and design your report to display data that's generated from the asset requests.

- **Exercise 1: Connect to Dataverse and transform data** - Start by creating a Power BI workspace, where your report will be published. In these exercises, you'll connect to your Dataverse for Teams Swag Request tables and use Power Query in Power BI to apply transformations to the data. Transforming the data is required so that it's in a user-friendly format for the report.

- **Exercise 2: Build your report in Teams** - Design your report and create visuals to display the data and insights.

- **Exercise 3: Use the report** - Add the report to your Teams channel.

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [Dataverse exercise file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/dataverse/dataverse-teams-exercise-files.zip) for use in this module. 

The following file folders are in this download:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
