The report is now ready for you to use and embed within Teams. In Teams, you can access Power BI reports and dashboards through the Power BI app, which is the tool that you've used to build the report. The Power BI app is a Teams-embedded version of Power BI Service. For easier access to the reports, you can embed the report in a channel for members to view and interact with.
