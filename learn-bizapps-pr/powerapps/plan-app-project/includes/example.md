In the scuba shop scenario, you've reviewed the current service process and have found some obvious improvements to make:

- Go paperless for the entire process. (You've noted the savings and environmental impact as a project benefit.)

- Look up the gear automatically that's being serviced based on the customer's purchase history.

- Do initial assessment checks and gather pictures, if needed, through the app. This approach will greatly reduce the time that it takes to gather that information from four potential sales team members and end-to-end process time.

- Create weekly service reports automatically by using the data.

- Send service reminders to customers every year.

- Provide the customer with status updates automatically as their gear is serviced.

- Identify the customers who are affected by a manufacturer's recall.

These automation opportunities don't address some obvious benefits in other departments, such as sales. Being able to keep track of the life of gear allows the sales department to reach out to customers with opportunities to buy new gear and new training.
