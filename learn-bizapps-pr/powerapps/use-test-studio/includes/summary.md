In this module, you learned how to improve your canvas apps by using Test Studio. By using this built-in Power Apps Studio tool, you can define a complete set of test cases to help ensure that your apps continue to provide the capabilities that these tests cover when new versions of the apps are deployed.

Maintaining high quality and avoiding bugs in areas of the app that are familiar to users helps fuel user adoption.

During the testing phase, you can include other members of the development team by communicating the results to them.

You also learned about the following concepts:

-   The value of defining a test strategy for business-critical apps

-   How to create test suites and cases that align with the test scenarios that are defined in the strategy

-   How to run tests with Test Studio and provide feedback on the test results to help troubleshoot issues
