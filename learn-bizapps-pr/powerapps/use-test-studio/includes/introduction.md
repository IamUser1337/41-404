In this self-paced module, learn how to improve the quality of your canvas apps by taking advantage of the testing functionalities of Microsoft Power Apps Test Studio.

## Overview

Testing apps is an important process that ensures the quality and functionality of those apps and prevents bugs. You can use Power Apps Test Studio to create and run these tests for canvas apps. Providing tested apps can improve user adoption by reducing the issues that people might encounter while using the apps.

Most likely, you've experienced bugs in an app, which might have impacted your overall perception of the app. Planning a test strategy that includes using Test Studio to validate your test cases can help you deploy and share high-quality canvas apps.

Some key benefits of using Test Studio are that you can:

-   Write tests by using Power Apps expressions, which are the same as the language that you use to build your apps. This feature makes Test Studio easier to learn and use.

-   Use a recorder to capture your app interactions and generate test steps automatically, thus saving you time and effort in creating tests.

-   Organize your tests into test suites, which are groups of test cases that focus on specific features or functionality of your app. This feature helps you manage your tests and run them selectively.

-   Run your tests in Test Studio or in a web browser, which gives you flexibility and convenience in testing your app.

-   Integrate your tests with your app deployment process by using tools like Power Apps Build Tools or GitHub Actions. This feature helps you automate your testing and verify the quality of your app before you release changes.

-   Store and analyze your test results by using data sources like Microsoft SharePoint or Microsoft Power Automate. This feature helps you track and improve your app performance and reliability.

Test Studio provides a base to help detect problems in apps and helps confirm that new capabilities that are added to an app aren't breaking the expected behavior of a new version of it.

Now that you've learned about some benefits of using Test Studio, you can learn how to create a testing strategy to prepare for your tests.
