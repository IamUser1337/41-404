Planning a testing strategy is as critical as your plan to build the app and distribute it. To create a testing strategy that includes Test Studio, follow these steps:

1. Identify the app features and functionalities that you want to test. You can use the app requirements, user stories, or user feedback as a source of information.

1. Prioritize the features and functionalities based on their importance, complexity, and frequency of use. You can use a matrix or a ranking system to help you with this step.

1. Identify the features and functionalities that are best suited for test automation and those that require manual testing. Test automation can save you time and effort, but it isn't suitable for all types of tests. Examples of tests that are best suited for automation include:

    -   Repetitive tests that need to be implemented frequently or across different environments or devices

    -   Data-driven tests that involve validating large sets of data or inputs

    -   Regression tests that verify that existing features aren't affected by new changes or updates

    -   Performance tests that measure the speed, responsiveness, and reliability of your app

1. Create test suites and test cases for each feature or functionality that you want to test. A test suite is a group of test cases that focus on a specific aspect of your app. A test case is a series of test steps that perform actions and validate results.

    For more information, see [Working with Test Studio - Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-test-studio#create-a-test-suite/?azure-portal=true).

5. Run your test cases in Test Studio or a browser, or integrate your test cases in your app deployment process. Then, analyze the results and ensure your app quality before you release changes.

You've now learned how to create a testing strategy to prepare your tests. Next, learn how to create and record a test by using Test Studio.
