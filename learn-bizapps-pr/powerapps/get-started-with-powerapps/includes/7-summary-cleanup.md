Congratulations on the start of your learning journey to be a Power Apps developer!

In this module, you discovered what Power Apps can do for your business, what data your apps can use, and how it can interact with Power Automate and Power BI.

You created your first apps by using an Excel table saved to OneDrive, and you saw the capabilities of Copilot in building an app with you.

We also learned about some important design considerations when building an app.

Hopefully, you're anxious to learn more about Power Apps, and we'll see you in the next module in this learning path!
