In the [Create a machine ordering app with Power Apps - Online workshop](/training/paths/power-apps-online-workshop/), you built a solution to manage the process for ordering coffee machines. This learning path/workshop extends that scenario, where you're working with Contoso Coffee, a distributor of consumer and commercial coffee and espresso machines. They need a simpler way for their various suppliers to update orders.

To complete the exercises in this module, download the [lab zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/power-pages/PowerPagesIADSupplierPortalStudent.zip). If you're reading this document, all files are in the same zip package. Within the zip file is another zip file called **StudentImport.zip**. Don't unzip it. You use it later.

Before you can start building your Microsoft Power Pages site, you'll need a Microsoft 365 tenant with a Microsoft Dataverse environment. You'll also need a Power Pages site. This exercise describes how to create it.

For more information, see [Power Pages Guidance Center on Microsoft Learn](/power-pages/guidance/?azure-portal=true).

## Why this setup is important

We recommend that everyone complete this setup prework. The reason why we recommend creation of a tenant and dedicated environment for each student is because participants usually encounter last-minute limitations of governance or security settings that vary and are unpredictable. For example, if your tenant can't use connectors, you'd have an issue with the app creating sample data. Alternatively, you might not have enough rights to create a Power Pages site because Microsoft Entra ID rights are locked, or your admins might have blocked non admins from creating Power Pages websites. Completing this setup prework will help avoid the need for instructors to triage tenant-specific limitations during training day.

You can skip this prework setup if you were told to skip it, if someone has given you alternative instructions with setup premade for you, or if someone has given you alternative instructions.

You can skip this setup prework at your own risk if you're certain that you've previously competed the Power Apps in a Day lab. Additionally, if you're able to create a Power Pages website in your tenant in a new Dataverse environment, then you can skip the detailed steps and set up a new Dataverse environment with Power Pages. To do so, select **Starter Layout one** further down in the instructions. Consider the new Developer Plan support in Power Pages if possible.

## Web browser mode

Use an InPrivate or Incognito browsing session to ensure that you aren't already signed in to your organization's tenant with your corporate credentials and are using your trial tenant. You can also use browser profiles. If the sign-in logos for your organization continue to display, as they would for some enterprise or government customers, you might consider using a personal machine.

## Who to contact for setup issues

If you have issues, always ask the organizers of your training workshop, if you're attending such an event. If you're completing your own self-paced learning, you'll need to contact your tenant IT department for help.
