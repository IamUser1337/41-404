[Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) is the data source for Power Pages. With Microsoft Dataverse, makers can use Power Apps to create model-driven apps and to work with data by using a view of data records in a grid or list. Then, makers can use a form to add, update, and view each record.

Power Pages sites are unique, but they have components that use these model-driven app views and forms as a foundation to build interactive, data-driven webpages. Your Power Pages site requires a Dataverse environment. To add a Dataverse environment to your trial, you'll create a Developer Environment.
