In this exercise, you'll create a website with Power Pages.

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. In the upper-right corner, confirm that you're in your developer environment (**[FirstName LastName]'s Environment**). If not, select the environment's name to switch to the developer environment. Don't select the default environment.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> [![Screenshot of Select environment with focus on the Pages Workshop option.](../media/environment.png)](../media/environment.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Get Started**.

1. A series of questions will appear, asking about your level of creating websites. Pick any option (it doesn't affect the process).

1. If you don't see the starter popup, follow these steps instead of the previous step:

   1. Select **Templates** from the left-side navigation.

		> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
		> [![Screenshot of the Templates option from the left-side navigation.](../media/templates.png)](../media/templates.png#lightbox)

   1. Select the **Starter Layouts** tab from the available tabs.

		> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
		> [![Screenshot of the starter layouts tab.](../media/starter.png)](../media/starter.png#lightbox)

1. Choose between **Starter layout 1**, **Starter layout 2**, or **Starter layout 3** and then select **Choose this template**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If you'd like to use the simplest layout, select **Template 1**. This is the layout used for the remainder of these lab guides.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> [![Screenshot of the Choose a template to see design details section with focus on the three starter layouts.](../media/template.png)](../media/template.png#lightbox)

1. Choose a name for the website, and modify the web address if needed. Later, if you convert from a trial to a production pages site, you can upload a certificate for a domain name that you own. Select **Done**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> [![Screenshot showing the Give your site a name and Create a web address fields.](../media/name.png)](../media/name.png#lightbox)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you receive an error that a Dataverse database is missing, it means that Dataverse isn't yet installed in the developer environment. Wait a few minutes before trying again.

You'll need to wait until the provisioning is complete before moving on to the next steps. While the website is provisioning, you can view its status update on [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> [![Screenshot of My sites showing the message Getting your site ready.](../media/provisioning.png)](../media/provisioning.png#lightbox)

A fully provisioned Power Pages site will now have a selectable **Edit** button, as shown in the following screenshot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> [![Screenshot of My sites with focus on the Edit button.](../media/edit.png)](../media/edit.png#lightbox)

Power Pages design studio will offer you a short tour.

Now, you've provisioned a Power Pages website.
