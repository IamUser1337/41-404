Congratulations on creating your first model-driven app!

Defining and enforcing consistent business processes is a key aspect of model-driven app design. Consistent processes help ensure that your app users can focus on their work and not have to remember to perform a set of manual steps.

Let's review what you've learned:

- Model-driven app design is based on your data. This approach focuses on quickly adding components including dashboards, forms, views, and charts.
- Little or no code is required to build model-driven apps.
- The best way to get started building model-driven apps is to use sample apps and data; then customize the apps.
