In this module, you learned about the AI Builder models in Power Apps.

Additionally, you learned how to differentiate prebuilt models and custom models.

This module explained the following concepts:

- Prebuilt models are ready to use, but they're not specific to your organization's data.

- Custom models require training based on data that you provide that suits the targeted business scenario.

- You're required to publish custom models before you can use them in Power Apps or Power Automate.

- Some models offer custom and prebuilt models, which allow you to address ready-to-go and customized scenarios.
