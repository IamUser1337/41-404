Webpage access security in Power Pages is provided by a **Web Page Access Control Rule** table. The **Table Permission** table controls user access to Microsoft Dataverse data. You can associate both with **Web Role** rows, which you can link to a Dataverse contact row. When a Dataverse contact is an authenticated website user, the permissions and access that are granted through the linked role will determine which pages and data they can view and interact with.

This module explained the following concepts:

- The relationship between a Dataverse contact table and a website user.

- The **Web Role** table and how you can use it in portal security.

- Restricting access to webpages by using webpage access control rules.

- Restricting or providing access to Dataverse on webpages by using table permissions.

- Setting up security for a Power Pages website.
