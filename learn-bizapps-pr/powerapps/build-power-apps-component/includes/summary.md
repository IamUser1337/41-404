Writing Power Apps code components is a great skill set for developers who want to extend a Power Apps application with custom presentation and logic you can't accomplish only through configuration or low code. This module reviewed how to create, package, and debug code components and how to install available sample components. You learned how to package a code component into a solution using the CLI push command during development or with a solution project to prepare a solution file for transporting the code component to other environments. You learned techniques for debugging code components and what to look for in console logs to identify problems.
