In this module, you started building a Microsoft Power Platform solution that revolves around a real estate company and its operations. You started with a Power Apps canvas app that real estate agents use to manage their properties.

The data for this app is stored in an Excel file, so you used the Excel to App feature from Copilot in Power Apps to create a canvas app with data from the Excel file. You also learned how to use Power Apps Ideas to generate and accelerate the formula writing experience to add more functionality and formatting to the app.
