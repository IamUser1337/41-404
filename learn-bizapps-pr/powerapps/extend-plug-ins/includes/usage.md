It's best practice to approach customizing a model-driven Power App with the idea that writing code is a last-resort method for achieving desired business application functionality. Quality areas such as maintainability, upgradability, stability, and performance should factor in when determining the best approach for a given scenario. Considering these quality areas is one of the most important skills that any Power Apps developer can have.

## Business rules vs. plug-ins

Occasionally, business rules aren't able to achieve certain objectives, or maybe their complexity causes developers to prefer writing the logic in a plug-in. One scenario could be if you have a complex "if/then/else" situation that would be more easily achieved in a *switch* statement, or when you're dealing with dynamic values that aren't readily accessible with a business rule. Client scripting is also an option for this scenario.

## Workflows/flows vs. plug-ins/client script

Circumstances might occur when existing limitations require you
to develop plug-ins to accomplish certain activities.

The following table can help you determine when it might be more appropriate to
use a workflow versus a plug-in or client script.
