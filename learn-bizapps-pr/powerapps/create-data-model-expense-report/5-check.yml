  questions:

    choices:
    - content: internalemailaddress
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This is simply a text column that stores the email address of the user.
    - content: fullname
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This is simply a text column that stores the users first name and last name.
    - content: mobilephone

      explanation: Incorrect. This is simply a phone type column that stores the mobile phone number of the user.
    - content: systemuserid
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This is the autogenerated global unique identifier (GUID). This column contains a string of letters, numbers, and dashes, which help the system classify individual records or items in the table. In some data sources, that column is a number, but in Dataverse it's a GUID.
  - content: What is one key advantage to using Dataverse as your data source when building canvas app solutions?
    choices:
    - content: You can define relationships between existing columns in tables.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. To create a relationship between tables in Dataverse, you need to create a new column exclusively for that purpose.
    - content: Dataverse has the most delegable functions out of the potential data sources.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While Dataverse does support several functions for delegation, other data sources, such as SQL, have more.
    - content: You can access system-created tables that pull in organizational information.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. With Dataverse you can utilize the Common Data Model, which allows you to access a series of predefined tables and information commonly used in many businesses, such as the User table.
    - content: Dataverse is the only free data source that you can access with Power Apps.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can store data in Excel or in SharePoint.
  - content: What is the difference between a one-to-many relationship and a many-to-one relationship?
    choices:
    - content: No difference, it depends on the table that you're starting with.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A one-to-many relationship for one table is a many-to-one relationship to the related table.
    - content: One-to-many relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Both relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Both relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships are only available in Dataverse.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Other data sources might not list many-to-one as an option, but it's the same as a one-to-many relationship.
