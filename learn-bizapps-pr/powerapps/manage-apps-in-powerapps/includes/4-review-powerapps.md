You have been through much learning in this learning path. Together we've built an app, customized our app, shared our app, created a new environment, and learned how to manage users in our environment.

Here's a quick review of what we've learned how to do:

- Build an app based on data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored in Microsoft OneDrive for Business. You learned that Microsoft Power Apps can connect almost as easily to data sources that you're already using in the cloud (such as Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, and Salesforce) or on-premises data sources.

- Customize an app to make it your own by modifying the appearance and behavior and adding Excel-like functions by using formulas.

- Share apps easily with your coworkers across the web, tablets, and mobile devices.

- Set up environments so that you can use to support ALM or other business functions.

The best way to advance your skills is to run the samples, practice using the templates, and generate more apps from your own data.
