This module explained the process of creating custom tables and columns. Having the correct table structure and column data types makes the model-driven app creation process easier. The relationships and data model are fundamental components when you're creating apps. When the relationships are set properly, it's easier to create views that allow the user to review relevant information, such as:

- Accidents that an employee has been involved in.

- Accidents in a specific location.

- Accidents that involve a specific type of accident.
