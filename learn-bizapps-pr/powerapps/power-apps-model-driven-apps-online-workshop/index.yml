title: Create a model-driven Power Apps app for machine ordering - Online Workshop
summary: |
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]
  In the first lab module, you built a Power Apps canvas application for an organization where, every few years, the employees go through a coffee machine replacement cycle. The application allows employees to request a machine by using the app that you built. In the second lab module, while using a custom table that you created in the Microsoft Dataverse lab, you stored that request for processing. From the requesting employee's point of view, after theyâ€™ve placed the order, the new coffee machine shows up, but a back-office process needs to happen to manage the procurement, setup of the device, and distribution of the machine to that requesting employee. In this lab, you'll build a Power Apps model-driven app that back-office staff who manage fulfilling machine requests will use. By using the model-driven app style, you can take advantage of the business process feature of model-driven apps to keep the back-office staff on track for each machine request.

    In this module, you'll:
    - Create a standalone model-driven app.
    - Customize forms for the model-driven app.
    - Use a business process flow to guide users through a process.
