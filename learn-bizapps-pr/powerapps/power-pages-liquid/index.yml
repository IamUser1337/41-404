  Liquid is an open-source template language that’s integrated natively into Power Pages. It acts as a bridge between Microsoft Dataverse and the HTML or text output that’s sent to the browser. You can use Liquid to add dynamic content to pages and to create various custom templates. Additionally, Liquid provides access only to the data and operations that the website explicitly allows.
