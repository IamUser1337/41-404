Liquid is integrated natively into Power Pages. It adds template processing to Power Pages, including logic, processing instructions, and Microsoft Dataverse access, to produce HTML or text output that's sent to the browser. You can use Liquid to add dynamic content to pages and to create various custom templates. Additionally, Liquid provides access only to the data and operations that portals explicitly allow.

In this module, you've learned about the following concepts:

- Liquid template language and how it's used in Power Pages.

- Liquid syntax and the basic structure of Liquid code.

- Liquid tags, objects, and filters.

## Next steps

Your next step would be to learn how to secure website content, static and dynamic, that the table lists, forms, and Liquid code generate.
