In this module, you learned how to build low-code plug-ins by using Power Fx for your logic. You can create instant low-code plug-ins that makers can use on-demand from Power Apps and Power Automate. Instant plug-ins are a great way to make your Power Fx logic reusable across multiple apps and flows. Additionally, you tested your instant plug-ins from the Dataverse Accelerator application.

You also learned about automated low-code plug-ins that you can trigger to run your custom Power Fx logic based on Dataverse table events. Automated plug-ins can run before or after you modify data in Dataverse, depending on the use case of your low-code plug-in. Automated plug-ins run regardless of how a user triggered the event, including from Power Apps, Power Automate, or from the Dataverse API.
