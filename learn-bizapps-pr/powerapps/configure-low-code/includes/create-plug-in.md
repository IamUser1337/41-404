You can create low-code plug-ins in any Microsoft Power Platform environment with Microsoft Dataverse provisioned. To create a low-code plug-in, use the Dataverse Accelerator application that's preinstalled in all environments.

By using the Dataverse Accelerator application, you can set up and test low-code plug-ins. When you create a new low-code plug-in by using the application, you can choose which Dataverse solution that the plug-in should be associated with. It's best to set up the Dataverse solution before you create the plug-in so that it's available to select during the creation process.

The following video demonstrates how to create a Dataverse solution and use the Dataverse Accelerator application to create a low-code plug-in.
