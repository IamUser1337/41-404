Adjusting any area of your deployment strategy could seem overwhelming. This unit discusses three essential change management concepts that you should consider as you look to improve your continuous deployment process.

## Break down silos and build empathy

Overcoming organizational inertia can be difficult because:

- When you work with teams that are resistant to change, building trust between teams and departments often takes time. People also need evidence that the changes will be beneficial. People who are pushing for the change also need to make it easier for those who are adopting the change so that they make the best choices.

- People who work in change management tend to be rational and detail oriented.

- People who work in change management tend to respond well to bound experiments in low-risk environments.

## Create feedback loops
Feedback loops should cover sentiment from IT teams and include the introduction of new capabilities. If a separate change management team is in place, involve them in the process early to collaborate and help shape designs.

## Measure the impact of your new approach
To measure the impact of your new approach, make your success visible.
