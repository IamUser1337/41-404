A healthy deployment process is essential to having a successful application lifecycle management (ALM) for Microsoft Power Platform. Ask yourself the following questions to assess the health of your continuous deployment process:

- Are you shipping managed solutions?

- Is production being serviced while you work on v-next?

- Are you testing post-deployment (smoke test, UI test, and others)?
