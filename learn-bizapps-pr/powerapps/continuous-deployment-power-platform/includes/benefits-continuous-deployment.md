The top benefits of continuous deployment are that it:

- Encourages configuration as code.

- Minimizes the time to deploy.

- Enables automated testing throughout the pipeline.

- Makes deploying to production a low-stress activity.

- Provides visibility and feedback cycles.

- Reduces time to mitigate incidents (TTM).

- Reduces time to remediate incidents (TTR).

- Provides a faster release cadence so that hotfixes can become part of the normal release cycle.

The ensuing topics provide an example of a continuous deployment workflow.
