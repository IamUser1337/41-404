With the Styling workspace feature in Microsoft Power Pages, you can apply global site styles through configuration or by uploading your own Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You can apply corporate branding updates and review changes in the preview on the right side of the app window. In this lab, you'll customize the styles of your site to align with Contoso Coffee's branding. If you prefer, you can use your own brand and have a style guide with color codes.
