This module explored the features of the address input and interactive map control. You explored the various use cases and configuration options of the address input control. Also, you discovered what output properties that you can use to further enhance your canvas app. Additionally, you learned about the interactive map use cases and configuration options. You also learned about the properties that you can set from the canvas app designer or within the canvas app by using formulas. You were able to view a working example of both controls working together within a canvas app. The map control in this example had a data source where users could view locations, add locations of their own, and view data that's associated with each pin. Finally, you discovered other geo locational features that you can use with a map control to help you with further research after completing this module.
