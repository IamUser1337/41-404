You can use more advanced features with map information. These extra features are especially helpful when you're using the interactive map while on a mobile device.

The **Location** function can help you get the latitude and longitude location of the current user by using the **Location.Latitude** and **Location.Longitude** variables in the application.

Additionally, options are available for you to provide information about the user's acceleration, compass direction (which direction the user is heading), and current altitude. These signals can be helpful when used with a map control to provide more context to the user's location. For more information, see [Acceleration, App, Compass, Connection, and Location signals in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/signals/?azure-portal=true).

For an example of these other controls being used in a canvas app, see [Create an app that uses mobile sensors](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/how-to/mobile-sensors/?azure-portal=true).
