Crafting the data in your app to suit your needs is a game-changer for usability and performance. Not every app requires users to wade through all the rows in a data source. In this module, you delved into the art of shaping data through filters, operators, and nifty functions in Power Apps. Here's a quick recap:

- **Filter Function**: Your go-to for fetching data that meets specific criteria defined in your formula.

- **Operators (And, Or, etc.)**: Get fancy with complex filters using these operators.

- **Search Function**: A powerful tool to query string columns, fetching only the rows that match the string, no matter where it lurks in the column.

- **AddColumns, DropColumns, RenameColumns, ShowColumns**: These functions are your secret weapons to tweak table columns within Power Apps without laying a finger on the original data source. The magic happens only within the app.

In the next module, you'll focus on how to work with forms and write
data by using the **Submit** function.
