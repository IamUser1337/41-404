  - content: You added a Power BI component to your webpage by using the Publish to web access type, and you added filtering by using Liquid tag. However, website users can still view the entire dataset. What could be the issue?
    choices:
    - content: The website users need to be signed in.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: By default, the Power BI Liquid tag uses anonymous authentication, which means that Power BI ignores the filter. Website users don't need to be signed in. Refreshing the cache has no effect on Power BI data. Row-level security doesn't affect Publish to web Power BI reports.
