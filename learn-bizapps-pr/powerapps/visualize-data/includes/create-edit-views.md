Your next task is to create a new view for a table or edit an existing one.

## Create a view

To create a view for a table in Power Apps maker portal, in the table's view list, follow these steps:

1. Select **New view**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the list of views for the Account table. Focus is on the New view option.](../media/new-view.png)](../media/new-view.png#lightbox)

1. Provide a **Name** and **Description** for the view and then select **Create**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Create a view form. Focus is on the Name and Description fields and on the Create option.](../media/name-description.png)](../media/name-description.png#lightbox)

1. You're now in the view designer. The next units explore more in depth the different features of this area. For now, select **Save** to proceed.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Partial screenshot of the view designer. Focus is on the Save option.](../media/save.png)

1. To render the view available to all other Power Apps users, select **Publish**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Partial screenshot of the view designer. Focus is on the Publish option.](../media/publish.png)

After you've closed the view designer, the newly created view will be added to the list of views that are related to the table.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the list of views for the Account table. Focus is on the newly created view named Sample new view.](../media/sample-new-view.png)](../media/sample-new-view.png#lightbox)

## Edit a view

To modify a view for a table in Power Apps maker portal, in the table's view list, follow these steps:

    > [![Screenshot of the list of views for the Account table. Focus is on a view named Accounts: Influenced Deals That We Won.](../media/accounts.png)](../media/accounts.png#lightbox)

1. After modifications have been completed, select **Save** to override the existing view, or select **Save As** to create a new view under a different name.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Partial screenshot of the view designer. Focus is on the Save and Save As options.](../media/save-as.png)
