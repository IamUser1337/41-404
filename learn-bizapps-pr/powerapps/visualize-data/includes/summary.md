In this module, you learned about the Dataverse table views and how to create new views to differentiate prebuilt models and custom models.

Additionally, you learned that you can:

- Use views in Power Apps to limit the number of records that are listed and to define the displayed columns.

- Choose from three different view types:

  - Public

  - System

  - Personal

- Display sort columns in the view and sort them in ascending or descending order.

- Create simple filters or use groups and Boolean And/Or conditions to create complex filters.
