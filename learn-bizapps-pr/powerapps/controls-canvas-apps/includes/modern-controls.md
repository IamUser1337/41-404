Microsoft is always working on new ways to not only make the application design experience easier, but also to improve the look and feel of the applications to users. One way that this is being done in Power Apps, is through Modern controls and themes.

The advantage of modern controls and themes are that they're quicker and simpler for makers to configure. Additionally, they also provide a more cohesive experience for end-users. Modern controls focus on accessibility, usability, and better performance, which makes them more visually appealing, highly functional, and intuitive to use.

Currently the following modern controls are available:

- [**Button**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-button/?azure-portal=true) - A control for interacting with an app by clicking or tapping.

- [**Link**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-link/?azure-portal=true) - Used to open hyperlinks in new tab.

- [**Progress bar**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-progress-bar/?azure-portal=true) - Displays the user's progress. It can be configured to show an exact progress or indeterminate for ongoing progress.

- [**Slider**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-slider/?azure-portal=true) - A control where a user can specify a value by dragging a handle.

- [**Tabs or tab list**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-tabs-or-tabs-list/?azure-portal=true) - Used to select a tab to move screens or act on app.

The following modern controls are in preview: *(Preview features are available for testing but shouldn't be used in production scenarios as the feature is subject to change.)*

- [**Badge**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-badge/?azure-portal=true) - A badge is a visual decoration that can be used to display content in a visually better way.

- [**Checkbox**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-checkbox/?azure-portal=true) - Used to select or clear an option to specify **true** or **false**.

- [**Date picker**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-date-picker/?azure-portal=true) - A control where a user can select to specify a date.

- [**Dropdown**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-dropdown/?azure-portal=true) - Allows a user to select a value from the list of items.

- [**Header**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-header/?azure-portal=true) - A control that creates a modern app header.

- [**Info button**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-info-button) - This control can be used to provide additional information to users.

- [**Radio group**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-radio-group/?azure-portal=true) - An input control that shows multiple options, of which users can select only one at a time.

- [**Spinner**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-spinner/?azure-portal=true) - Displays state in motion. These are often used when loading a page or table.

- [**Table**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-table/?azure-portal=true) - A control that shows a set of data in a tabular or list format.

- [**Text**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-text/?azure-portal=true) - Display text on the app, can also be used as label for fields.

- [**Text input**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-text-input/?azure-portal=true) - A box in which the user can type text, numbers, and other data.

Once a modern control is added to your app, they have properties that can be configured like the classic controls. The properties that are available vary from component to component. You can learn more about the different modern controls that are available here: [Modern controls and properties in canvas apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-reference/?azure-portal=true).

## Enable modern controls and themes

Currently modern controls and themes need to be enabled on an app-by-app basis. Once they're turned on for your application, you can add both classic and modern controls to it.

To enable modern controls, on the command bar, select **Settings** > **Upcoming features**. From the Preview tab, set the toggle for **Modern controls and themes** to **On**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The setting to enable modern controls will move to the General section instead of Upcoming features.

Once they're enabled, modern controls are available by selecting the **Insert** icon on the side of the app designer. There are two tabs to choose from:

- **Classic**: Provides a list of available classic controls that can be added to your app.

- **Modern**: Provides a list of available modern controls that can be added to your app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Insert menu on the Modern tab.](../media/modern-controls.svg)](../media/modern-controls.svg#lightbox)

Like modern controls, users can use modern themes. Modern themes are available by selecting **Themes** on the app authoring menu.
