Previously, you learned that by using the related action, you can view the accidents that an employee has been involved in. In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to modify that view to add more details about the accident. As a result, users can view the accident details without having to select each accident individually.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the AccidentTable Associated View.](../media/associated.png)](../media/associated.png#lightbox)

The preceding image shows that the name of the view is **AccidentTable Associated View**. You can modify the view to add more details about the accident. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Tables** in Microsoft Dataverse.

1. Find the **AccidentTable** in the list of tables.

1. Select **Views** and then find and select **AccidentTable Associate View** to open it the designer studio.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Views tab on the AccidentTable.](../media/views.png)](../media/views.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Table columns** designer, ensure that these fields are added or already in the view from your **AccidentTable** to see details of the event in the view (remember you can drag and drop to adjust the order):

    - **AccidentDescription**

    - **AccidentDate**

    - **ManagerComments**

    - **ManagerReviewed**

1. Now switch to the related table columns by selecting the **Related** tab from under the **Table columns** pane on the left, and add/confirm the following fields:

    - **LocationName**

    - **AccidentName**

    - **AccidentSeverity**

    - **Status**

1. Select **Publish** to save and finish the process.

1. Return to your **Accident Tracking Application**.

1. Go to **EmployeeTables** and then select the **Renata Hall** record.

1. Select **Related** > **AccidentTables**.

    The view that you updated should now be visible, along with the added fields.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of AccidentTable Associated View showing the added fields.](../media/fields-added.png)](../media/fields-added.png#lightbox)

This exercise demonstrates that, after you update/publish a view, the results will be shown in your model-driven app. Changes in table views and forms automatically reflect in model-driven apps.
