We hope you enjoyed learning some ways to build User Interface in your canvas app. We have learned how to take advantage of **Themes** in our app, and how Power Apps provides you with multiple theming options. We also learned how to incorporate branding into our app with custom coloring, even how to use custom coloring and fonts.

We learned how to incorporate Icons and Images into our app, and we also learned how to bring in the **User** function to make personalized apps.

Finally, we learned how to build and check apps on different form factors.
