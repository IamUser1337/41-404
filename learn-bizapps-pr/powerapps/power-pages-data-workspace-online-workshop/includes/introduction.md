With the **Data** workspace in Microsoft Power Pages, you can visualize and manage business data for the site with tables, forms, and lists. All data and changes are stored in Microsoft Dataverse. In this lab, you'll create a Dataverse form that will be used on your Power Pages site. The process uses similar tools that you'd use when creating model-driven apps from Microsoft Power Apps.
