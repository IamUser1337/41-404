  A Power Pages maker should consider specific details when designing and building Power Pages websites. Implementing a website solution requires knowledge of the specific business requirements and needs of the customer. Along with being simplistic and well-designed, a successful website should provide functionality in consideration of geographical location, language, and accessibility needs. Additionally, makers should ensure that website metadata is backed up to source control and deployed to test and production environments in a consistent and structured way.
