Microsoft Dataverse provides a robust API to enable interaction with its underlying data and actions. This module reviewed the different ways to query and manipulate Dataverse data and explained how to authenticate using the Service Client. You also learned about the different approaches to working with the data using late-bound and early-bound techniques. When using early-bound, you can generate classes specific to your Dataverse tables and use them when performing operations against a Dataverse environment.
