Understanding your data source is key when creating apps. In this module, we explored the concept of delegation in Power Appsâ€”what it is, the factors influencing its availability, and ways to tweak delegation limits. Here are the key takeaways:

- Delegation boosts performance by minimizing data exchanges between Power Apps and the data source.

- The ability to delegate varies based on the function, predicate, and data source used.

- When delegation isn't possible, Power Apps alerts the app creator within the Power Apps Studio but doesn't notify the app user.

- By default, a non-delegable query returns 500 records, but this can be increased to a maximum of 2,000 for more extensive data retrieval.

In the upcoming module, you dive into expanding your access to various data sources by constructing custom connectors.
