In the previous unit, you gained insights into using functions to establish connections between related tables. This capability enables you to construct apps that effectively utilize relational data. Particularly with Microsoft Dataverse, relationships are defined at the table level, laying a structured foundation for your data connections.

With these relationships established, Power Apps offers a convenient dot (.) notation that allows you to navigate into related data directly. This dot notation serves as a shortcut, minimizing the necessity for numerous LookUp functions within your app. By using dot notation, you can access and work with related data seamlessly, reducing complexity and streamlining your app's logic. This approach simplifies your codebase, making it more intuitive and efficient when dealing with relational data in Power Apps.

The following video shows how to configure a relationship in Dataverse.
