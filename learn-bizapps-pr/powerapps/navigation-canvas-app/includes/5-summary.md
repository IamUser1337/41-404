Adding navigation options for your users creates a more dynamic user experience for your app. With the various options, you can tailor your app to behave in the way you want. Remember that you can:

- Use the `Navigate` function to send users to any screen in your app.

- Use the `Back` function to send users to the screen that they previously moved from.

- Create other navigational functionality by using `OnSuccess` for a `Form` control, `OnTimerEnd` for a `Timer` control, and `OnChange` for a `Dropdown` control.

By using a combination of controls, properties, functions, and formulas, you can develop an app that's simple to use. But adding navigation to your app in multiple ways isn't always the best thing to do. Keep your app simple and intuitive for your users to interact with.
