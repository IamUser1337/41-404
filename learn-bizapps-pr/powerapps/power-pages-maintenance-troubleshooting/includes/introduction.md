A Microsoft Power Pages website is an external-facing application that's often open to an external audience. It's critical that the website is accessible and operational because it reflects the image of an organization.

## Roles

A user doesn't need to be a global administrator to complete administrative tasks. Members of different roles can complete different administrative tasks in Power Pages. The admin and security roles that are required to do these tasks vary depending on the impact area.

The portal owner or a user with the system customizer role can complete most of the tasks. Some tasks might require that the user is a member of admin roles in [Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide&azure-portal=true). Others might need a membership to security roles in the [Microsoft Power Platform environment](/power-platform/admin/database-security/?azure-portal=true) or other permissions in Microsoft Entra ID.

For more information about the security requirements for Power Pages management and administration, see [Roles required for Power Pages administration](/power-pages/admin/admin-roles?azure-portal=true).

## Responsibilities

Power Pages administrators ensure that the website operates smoothly, effectively, and quickly by regularly maintaining and upgrading Power Pages solutions. They're also responsible for deploying and setting up new features of Power Pages while addressing and resolving problems that arise.
