This module explored some common scenarios for customizing the command bars in Power Apps model-driven apps. Using Power Fx logic, you can implement custom commands that handle various use cases. This module taught you how to include multiple data sources in your logic. You saw how using Notify and Confirm functions can improve the user experience for your app users. Using DataSourceInfo and RecordInfo, you can implement logic to hide or show command bar commands based on the user's permissions to the data. By combining these techniques, you can provide app users with command bar commands that implement their unique requirements.
