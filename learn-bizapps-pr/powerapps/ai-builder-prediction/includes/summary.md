In this module, you learned about the AI Builder prediction model.

Through the different units, you learned how to prepare data to create and train the model and how to use the outcome of the model in a model-driven app.

Additionally, you learned about the following concepts:

- AI Builder prediction and how it can apply to business scenarios

- Three outcome patterns that can be determined by AI Builder prediction:

    - **Binary prediction** - A choice between two options.

    - **Multiple outcome prediction** - A choice from a predefined list of options.

    - **Numerical prediction** - When a question is answered with a number.

- How to prepare data and select columns that might influence the outcome prediction

- How to create and train a prediction model

- How to use the prediction model outcome in a model-driven app
