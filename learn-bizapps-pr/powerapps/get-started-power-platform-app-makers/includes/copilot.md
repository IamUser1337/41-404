Microsoft Copilot is changing the way that users work. It helps developers as they write code. Additionally, you can use it in cloud flows to create automation that helps streamline your workflow through natural language expressions. You can create a flow by describing what you need through multiple steps of conversation. In Microsoft Power Platform, you can bring AI-powered Copilot to app makers and their users in Power Apps. With Copilot, you can build an app, including the data behind it, by describing what you need through multiple steps of conversation. As a result, your apps have Copilot-powered experiences that are built in from the first screen so that your users can discover insights in conversation rather than by using mouse clicks.

For more information about how to use the new AI features in Power Apps, see the following documentation:

The cloud flows in Copilot can perform the following actions:

-   Understand your intent and create a flow based on the scenario prompt that you provide.

-   Set up connections automatically on your behalf to get you to a working automation.

-   Apply the necessary parameters in the flow based on your prompt.

-   Respond to your requests to make changes to your flow, such as update actions and replace actions.

-   Answer questions about your flow and product, for example:

    -   **Flow question** - *What does my flow do?*

    -   **Product question** - *How do I access child flows?* or *How do I access licenses?*

## How to write a good prompt

Writing good prompts includes more than being specific in your request or explaining how you want your results to be displayed. With Copilot, you can try different variations of prompts to help you evaluate what works best. If the initial results aren't what you're looking for, modify your prompt and then run it again.

-   For better and more accurate results, provide prompts in a *When X happens, do Y* format.

-   Be as specific as possible. Instead of a generic prompt, such as *I want to process an email*, try this prompt instead: *When an email arrives, I want to post the subject of the email to 'Contoso' Teams General channel*.

-   If possible, mention the connector in your prompt. For example, include Outlook, Teams, or Forms.

-   Try modifying your prompt to improve it.
