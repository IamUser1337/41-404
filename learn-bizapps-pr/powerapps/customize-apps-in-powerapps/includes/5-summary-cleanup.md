In this module we learned how to customize an app in Power Apps by adding controls, formatting, and logic.

Now you can do the following:

-   Change the layout of a Gallery

-   Change the data displayed in a control

-   Change the order in which fields appear

-   Format a number as price

-   Color text based on dynamic values

-   Add basic navigation into an app
