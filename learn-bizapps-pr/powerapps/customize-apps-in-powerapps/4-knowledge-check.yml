    - content: Navigate and Back
      explanation: Correct. The Navigate function allows you to designate which screen you want to send your user to.

  - content: What is the purpose of including a Gallery control in your app?
    choices:
    - content: To enable you to edit a record.

      isCorrect: false
    - content: To show images that might or might not be related to your app.
      explanation: Incorrect. Though you can show images that might be in your data with a Gallery control, thatâ€™s not the primary purpose of a Gallery. You use one to display and select from all records from your data. 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: To display and select from all records from your data source.
      explanation: Correct. A Gallery is a powerful control enabling you to see all records from your data source and to select from them.
      isCorrect: true
    - content: To display a single record.
      explanation: Incorrect. A Gallery is far more powerful than this, enabling you to display all records from your data source and to select from them. A form control is designed to portray a single record.
      isCorrect: false
