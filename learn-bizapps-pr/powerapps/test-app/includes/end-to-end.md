As previously mentioned, test scenarios should be related to findings during the planning and designing phases. Unit testing is completed programmatically end-to-end, whereas users complete tests. For that reason, tests must include enough detail so that users understand the task at hand. Additionally, tests need to anticipate the amount of detail that changes from organization to organization. 

Essentially, when you’re creating test scenarios, consider what you know about your users. For example, based on what you know about the user who was selected for UAT, you’ll know whether the name of the step contains enough information for that user to perform the test. Moreover, you’d know whether you’ll need to write a detailed script that users can follow verbatim.

Many tools are available to help you write the features and functions that must be tested and to track detailed results. The following example shows a Microsoft Excel test case template.

Regardless of the tool that you use to track the progress in these tests, ensuring collaboration between participants can add tremendous clarity regarding who is testing which task and scenario.
