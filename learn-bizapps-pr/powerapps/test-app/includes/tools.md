## Solution checker

The solution checker is a tool that allows you to perform a rich static analysis check on your solutions against a set of best practice rules. It helps you quickly identify problematic patterns.

The solution checker analyzes these Microsoft Dataverse solution components:

-   Custom workflow activities

-   Web resources (HTML and JavaScript)

-   Configurations such as SDK message steps

After the check completes, you'll receive a detailed report that lists the identified issues, the components and code that's affected, and links to documentation that describes how to resolve each issue.

For more information, see [Use solution checker to validate your model-driven apps in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/use-powerapps-checker/?azure-portal=true).
