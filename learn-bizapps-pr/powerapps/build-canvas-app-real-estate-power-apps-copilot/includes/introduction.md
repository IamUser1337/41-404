With Copilot in Microsoft Power Apps, you can build an app, including the data behind it, by describing what you need through multiple steps of conversation. Your apps have Copilot-powered experiences built in from the first screen, so your users can discover insights in conversation instead of using mouse clicks.

The AI assistant is available from the Power Apps home screen. You can tell the AI assistant what kind of information that you want to collect, track, or show. Then, the assistant will generate a Microsoft Dataverse table and use it to build your canvas app.
