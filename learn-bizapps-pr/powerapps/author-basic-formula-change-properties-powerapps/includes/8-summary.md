Formulas enhance functionality, performance, and user experience in your app. In this module, you learned about formulas:

- How to modify control properties using formulas

- How to use formulas to do calculations

- And how to use conditional formatting in your app.

Some important items to remember are:

- Conditional formatting can be used to change the color of text based on values, to show or hide fields, or even to disable fields based on a condition. It's a great way to enhance the usability of your app.

- Use the calculation functions within your app to do aggregate functions and return values. This allows you to complete calculations in the app without needing other tools.

- Each control type has a unique set of properties. Use these properties to modify the functionality and format of controls.

- Use the validation functions (including **IsBlank**, **IsBlankOrError**, **IsEmpty**, **IsNumeric**, **IsToday**, and **IsMatch**) to prevent errors and prevent slowdowns in the processing of the data.

We hope you enjoyed this learning module! In the next module in this learning path, we'll learn how to create basic formulas to change behaviors in a Power Apps canvas app.

Before we depart this module, here are some valuable references for all developers.
