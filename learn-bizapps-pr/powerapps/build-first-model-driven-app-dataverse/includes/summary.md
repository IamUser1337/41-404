We only scratched the surface of what we can do with Model-Driven apps and how it's powered by Dataverse. We first-hand saw how easy it's to build a table and set up relationships in Dataverse. Tables are used to model and manage business data. When you develop an app, you can use standard tables, custom tables, or both. Microsoft Dataverse provides standard tables by default that are designed, in accordance with best practices, to capture the most common concepts and scenarios within an organization.

To review, this module explained the following concepts:

-   Dataverse data is stored in tables.

-   There are numerous default tables available out-of-the box to help you quickly build apps.

-   You can create custom tables.

-   Data is stored in a way that users can only view it if you grant them access.

-   Sample model-driven apps and templates are available to help you learn and create your own apps.
