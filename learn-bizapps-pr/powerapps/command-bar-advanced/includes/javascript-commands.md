In addition to using Power Fx to implement the logic for a command's action, you can also use JavaScript. The following are some of the key reasons you might consider using JavaScript instead of Power Fx:

-   You already have the logic in JavaScript from a classic command bar command.

-   You want your command to be available in multiple apps when the same table and without duplication of your command and Power Fx logic.

-   You want your command to be globally available in any app in your environment and only bound to the command bar location, not an app or table.

To implement a command's action using JavaScript perform the following steps:

-   Create a file containing the JavaScript function

-   Upload the file as a JavaScript library

-   Create your new command

-   Choose Run JavaScript for the action type

-   Pick your JavaScript library

-   Provide your JavaScript function

-   Configure the parameters required by your function

In the following video, we'll walk through implementing a command using JavaScript.
