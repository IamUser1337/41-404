title: Create a Power Apps for Teams app for Contoso Coffee - Online Workshop
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  In this lab, you'll create an app for Microsoft Teams that allows employees to request Contoso Coffee swag (branded apparel and accessories). Power Apps is a low-code/no-code tool that you can use to build your own custom business applications by using drag and drop functionality. In this module, you'll discover how to use Microsoft Dataverse for Teams to build your own data model and store data. From the data model that you create, you'll build an app by using Power Apps, which gives users a front-end interface to perform a task and interact with data. You'll start by creating a Dataverse instance with tables that relate to the swag ordering scenario. The tables will store details of the available assets for order, and then you'll build an app that employees can use to submit their requests.
