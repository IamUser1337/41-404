In this lab, you created a data model for storing asset information and requests for swag orders by using Microsoft Dataverse for Teams. Then, you learned how to build an app to connect to your data model for employees to interact with. You were able to set up and design the app by using different styling and formulas for customization. Finally, you published the app to a Microsoft Teams channel so that members of the team can use it.
