This module has three exercises:

- **Exercise 1: Create a Dataverse instance** - You'll start by creating a team and a Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environment. You'll create your data model that's used for the Swag Request scenario in Microsoft Dataverse. This exercise includes creating your tables and columns for the data that users will be interacting with in your app.

- **Exercise 2: Customize the app** - You can customize the app that employees will use to submit their swag requests. Customizing the app in this exercise involves editing the fields that are available on the asset request submission form and changing formatting, such as colors and font.

- **Exercise 3: Publish and share your app** - Publish the app to Microsoft Teams. It will be available for Team members to use within Microsoft Teams on desktop, web, and mobile clients.
