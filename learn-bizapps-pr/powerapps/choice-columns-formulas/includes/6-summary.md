Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use Power Fx formulas to work with Microsoft Dataverse choice columns. Choice columns present the user with a fixed list of values that are defined by the maker. They allow the selection of a single value or multiple values. These column types are commonly used to filter rows from tables by using the Filter() Power Fx function. Editing these columns is straightforward, with the built-in edit form support that automatically configures the form fields. Additionally, the Patch() function helps you modify the column values individually to support scenarios that are unsuitable for using forms.
