  - content: You want website visitors to be able to locate specific records in a list view based on an option value in the Microsoft Dataverse record. What is the best way to accomplish this task?
    choices: 
    - content: Enable search in the List settings
      isCorrect: false

The filter (or metadata filter) option is the best solution for allowing users to filter on specific choice values. Increasing the number of records for each page won't help users locate data.
