    choices:
    - content: Having lookups to other data sources within a gallery
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This action creates performance-expensive lookups and slows down your app. The best option from this list is to limit the data that your app is pulling in.
    - content: Using large file size graphic images in a screen background
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A mobile user might be hard-pressed to quickly pull in a large image into the app over a metered data connection. The best option from this list is to limit the data that your app is pulling in.
    - content: Using multiple data sources in the same form
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Forms behave the best when all of their data is coming from the same data source. The best option from this list is to limit the data that your app is pulling in.
    - content: Limit the data that your app is pulling in
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Any of the other options might create an app performance drain. Filtering the data that you bring into any part of your app is a good technique to enhance performance.
