You can use Power Automate to help ensure that the solution performs repetitive tasks automatically instead of a user manually performing them.

The designing phase of this implementation identified multiple scenarios that you can automate within your app. For example, your customer has recently picked up their gear from being serviced in the shop. Afterward, you set up an automatic notification for 12 months from now to remind the customer that it's time to book their next service appointment. You'll build this flow in the next exercise.

Multiple types of flows are available for you to create with Power Automate. You can create [cloud flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#cloud-flows), [desktop flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#desktop-flows), or [business process flows](/power-automate/flow-types?azure-portal=true#business-process-flows). Watch the following video for a demonstration of the types of flows that you can create.
