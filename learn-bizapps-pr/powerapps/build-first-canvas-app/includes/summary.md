In this module, you learned about the endless possibilities for automation, simplification, and process improvement in Power Apps.

Power Apps is a low-code development platform with a suite of apps, services, and connectors that you can use to quickly build custom apps.

When creating, sharing, and administering apps, you can use the [Power Apps home page](https://make.powerapps.com), Power Apps Studio, and Microsoft Power Platform admin center.

The power of Power Apps comes from the ability to connect to related technologies in your business without being a coder. Examples of these technologies include Microsoft Dataverse, Power Automate, SharePoint, and other data sources.

Multiple ways are available for you to create a new app, including from a template, a data source (such as SharePoint), or a blank canvas.
