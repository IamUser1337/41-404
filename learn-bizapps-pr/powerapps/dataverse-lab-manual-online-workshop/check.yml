    - content: Use a choice column.
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: Create a Warranty custom table.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: Create a Warranty Expires date column on the Machine Order table.
      isCorrect: true

    - content: Store the date in the description column for each Machine Order row.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Users can store this information as text, but it isn't stored in a way that allows the date to be used in context. It's best saved as a date data type.
    - content: Use Power Automate.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You could use Power Automate to automate setting the date or using the date as a trigger for actions. The data would still need to be contained in a column.
