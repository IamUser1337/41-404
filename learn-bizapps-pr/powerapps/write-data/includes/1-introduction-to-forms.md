The **Form** control is used to work with an individual record from a data source. Forms can be used to view, edit, and create records.

There are two types of form controls: **Edit Form** and **Display Form**. The **Edit Form** has the View, Edit, and New form modes, while the **Display Form** only has the View form mode.

There's an added benefit of the **Form** control for the app maker. When you add a **Form** control to your canvas, a panel helps you add your data source, modify the view, choose the columns to be displayed, and more. Forms are a powerful addition to your Power Apps skill set. Note, forms work with all [tabular data sources](/training/modules/work-with-external-data/1-data-source-overview/?azure-portal=true) except collections.

## Properties of a control

This section isn't unique to the **Form** control but serves as a reminder. At the top of the screen in the Power Apps Studio is the **Properties** drop-down menu and the **Formula** bar. Both will be referenced throughout the remainder of this module.
