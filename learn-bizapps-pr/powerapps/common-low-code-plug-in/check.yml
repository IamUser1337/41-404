  questions:
  - content: You create an instant low-code plug-in and set it as global. How would you invoke the plug-in from a canvas app?
    choices:
    - content: Use the plug-in by referencing from the Dataverse table, such as Accounts.IsValidAccountNumber()
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You wouldn’t invoke the global low-code plug-in with this action.
    - content: Use the plug-in by referencing from the environment language object, such as Environment.IsValidAccountNumber()
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Global plug-ins aren't bound to a specific table, and you can call them from the environment language object.
    - content: Use them as you would any other Power Fx function, such as IsValidAccountNumber()
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You wouldn’t invoke the global low-code plug-in with this action.
    - content: You can't use global low-code plug-ins from Power Apps
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can use global low-code plug-ins from Power Apps.

    choices:
    - content: Set up a connection reference for the connector in the same solution
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This action allows you to use the connector actions in the Power Fx expression.
    - content: Set up a connection for the connector
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You wouldn’t complete this action first to use a Microsoft Power Platform connector from a low-code plug-in.
    - content: No setup is required to use a Microsoft Power Platform connector from a low-code plug-in
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A setup action is required before you can use a Microsoft Power Platform connector from a low-code plug-in.
  - content:  You create an instant low-code plug-in and set it as Entity by using the Account table. How would you invoke the plug-in from a Power Automate cloud flow?
    choices:
    - content: Use the Dataverse connector and a step by using the Perform a bound action operation.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Perform a bound action allows you to pass the reference to the table that’s required by a low-code plug-in that’s set up for a specific entity.
    - content: Use the Dataverse connector and a step by using the Perform an unbound action operation.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You wouldn’t use this action to invoke the plug-in from a Power Automate cloud flow.
    - content: You can't use an instant low-code plug-in that’s set as Entity from Power Automate
