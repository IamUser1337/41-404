summary: | 
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  With Dataverse low-code plug-ins, you can create reusable Power Fx logic that runs on demand or in response to a Dataverse data event. You can use low-code plug-ins to implement data validation and data manipulation of your Dataverse data. Low-code plug-in logic can use Microsoft Power Platform connectors as part of their logic. You can use instant plug-ins from Power Apps canvas apps and Power Automate flows.
