With Microsoft Dataverse low-code plug-ins, you can create reusable Microsoft Power Fx logic that runs on demand or in response to a Dataverse data event. You can use low-code plug-ins to implement data validation and data manipulation of your Dataverse data. Low-code plug-in logic can use Microsoft Power Platform connectors as part of their logic. Additionally, you can use instant plug-ins from Microsoft Power Apps canvas apps and Microsoft Power Automate flows.
