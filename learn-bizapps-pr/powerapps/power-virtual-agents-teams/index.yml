summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Power Virtual Agents empowers subject matter experts to build intelligent conversational bots by using a guided, no-code graphical interface. By using Power Automate, you can call flows from your copilot topics, connecting your copilot to other data sources so that it can act on behalf of the user.
  
  Power Virtual Agents is available as an app in Microsoft Teams, enabling you to create an internal copilot. This solution is ideal if you want to create a copilot to answer common internal questions that are posed by employees, particularly for areas such as IT and human resources, which handle multiple frequently asked questions.
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you want to create a copilot for customers to deploy on your website or other channels, you can use the full version of Microsoft Copilot Studio.
