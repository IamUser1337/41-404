In this exercise, you'll set up the chatbot to interact with the Dataverse for Teams tables that you created in a previous lab in this learning path. Your goal is to make sure that the user can submit a request for swag by using the chatbot. To do so, you'll use the embedded flow experience inside the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams.

## Task: Get the schema name for your Dataverse for Teams table

To get the schema name for your Dataverse for Teams table, follow these steps:

1. When you create your Dataverse for Teams tables and columns, each component is given a technical or schema name behind the scenes. You'll need to find that technical or schema name to use it in your flow. Return to Microsoft Power Apps by using the icon on the Teams left navigation bar. Select the **Build** tab and then select the team that you've been working in. Select the Asset table in the list of created items.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Build tab and Asset table.](../media/build.png)](../media/build.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Columns**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot showing the Columns option selected.](../media/columns.png)](../media/columns.png#lightbox)

1. A behind-the-scenes view of your table and columns will show. Beneath the **Name** header are schema names, shown in a format like **crao5_AssetId**. Your schema names might differ; you'll have your own unique prefix that isn't similar to this example.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the schema names in the Columns section.](../media/column-names.png)](../media/column-names.png#lightbox)

1. Note your schema names for the following columns; you'll need them in this task and in subsequent tasks.
    
    **Asset**

    **Asset Name**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the schema names of Asset and Asset Name for the column.](../media/schema-names.png)](../media/schema-names.png#lightbox)

1. Return to Power Virtual Agents by using the icon on the Teams left navigation bar. Select the **Chatbots** tab and then select the chatbot that you've been working on to open it.

## Task: Create a new topic

To create a new topic, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Topics** and then select **+ New topic**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the New topic button.](../media/new-topic-flow.png)](../media/new-topic-flow.png#lightbox)

1. Add the following trigger phrases and then select the button after each until all appear in the list:

   *Want to order swag*

   *I need to make a request for merch*

   *Can I put in a request?*

   *Place an order for swag*

   *How do I put in an order?*

1. Select **Details** and then enter **Request swag** in the **Name** box. Close the **Details** pane.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Details pane, showing Request swag entered in the Name box.](../media/details-name-box.png)](../media/details-name-box.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Message** box, add the following text:

    *I can help you request Contoso Coffee swag*. 
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot showing text being entered in the Message box.](../media/trigger-message.png)](../media/trigger-message.png#lightbox)

1. Save your bot before continuing to the next task by selecting the **Save** icon in the upper-right corner.

## Task: Create a flow to get a row from a Dataverse for Teams table

Power Virtual Agents in Teams comes with a built-in experience for Microsoft Power Automate, with templates to help make it easier for you to get your chatbot to call an action. In this task, you'll use Power Automate to look up the first item in your Assets table in Dataverse for Teams and then return that item as a suggestion for the user to request that item. 

1. Add a node and select **Call an action**. Select **Create a flow**, which will launch Power Automate inside Microsoft Teams.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Create a flow option.](../media/create-flow.png)](../media/create-flow.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Power Virtual Agents Flow Template**. This template is designed to pass inputs from the chat to a flow and then provide outputs from the flow back to Power Virtual Agents.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting Power Virtual Agents Flow Template.](../media/virtual-agent-flow.png)](../media/virtual-agent-flow.png#lightbox)

1. A screen might appear to confirm your flow connections. Select **Continue**.

1. The flow template should display, with the Power Virtual Agents input and output steps. You're not bringing inputs from the chat into this flow, so you donâ€™t need to do anything in that first stage. Select **Add an action** between the input and output steps.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Add an action button.](../media/add-action.png)](../media/add-action.png#lightbox)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the number one being entered in the Row count box.](../media/row-count.png)](../media/row-count.png#lightbox)

1. Compose a variable to store the information from the item that you retrieved in the previous step so that it's easier to pass it back to the chatbot. Add an action underneath this one, search for **compose**, and then select the **Compose (Data Operation)** action.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Compose Data Operation action.](../media/compose.png)](../media/compose.png#lightbox)

1.	In the action step, select the **Inputs** box, and then select the **Expression** tab in the **Dynamic content** box that appears. Enter the following expression into the function box of the **Expression** area of **Dynamic content** and then select **OK**. This expression gets the value of the item: 

    `first(body('List_rows')?['value'])`

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Inputs box and the Expression tab to add an expression.](../media/expression.png)](../media/expression.png#lightbox)

	A formula will show in the **Inputs** box.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Add an output button.](../media/add-output.png)](../media/add-output.png#lightbox)

1.	Select **Text** and then enter the title as **Name**. In the **Enter a value to respond** box, go to the **Expression** tab on the **Dynamic content** box and then enter the following formula. Substitute the schema name for your own schema name (the word **Name**, as shown in the following screenshot) for the **Asset Name** column in your table that you noted previously. Your schema name will have a different prefix. Select **OK**.

    `outputs('Compose')?['cra05_Name']`
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Enter a value to respond box, showing a formula entered in the Expression tab.](../media/return-value.png)](../media/return-value.png#lightbox)

1.	Repeat the previous step to add the ID to the outputs. Select **+ Add an output > Text**. Enter the title as **ID**. In the **Enter a value to respond** box, go to the **Expression** tab on the **Dynamic content** box and then enter the following formula. Substitute the highlighted schema name for your own schema name for the **Asset** column in your table that you noted previously. Your schema name will have a different prefix. Select **OK**.

    `outputs('Compose')?['cra05_AssetId']`

   Formulas will show in both output boxes.
