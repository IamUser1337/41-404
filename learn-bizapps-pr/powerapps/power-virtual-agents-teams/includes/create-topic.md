In this task, you'll create a topic for the bot to answer common questions from employees about Contoso Coffee swag.

## Task: Turn off the lesson topics

Your first task is to turn off the lesson topics, which aren't needed as part of this chatbot.

1. The list of existing topics are **Lesson 1**, **Lesson 2**, **Lesson 3**, and **Lesson 4**. Switch the **Status** toggle for each topic to the **Off** position.

    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Status toggle for each position turned off.](../media/status-toggle.png)](../media/status-toggle.png#lightbox)
 
1. Wait a few seconds for each topic to turn off. A progress message will display, followed by a confirmation message at the top of the topics list.

    > [![Screenshot highlighting the confirmation message at the top of the topic list.](../media/confirmation-message.png)](../media/confirmation-message.png#lightbox)

## Task: Create a new topic for questions

   *Need information on swag*

   *Can I get branded clothes*

   *What swag is available?*

   *What branded Contoso Coffee things do we have?*

   Your topic is now saved and you can edit it in the authoring canvas, with your trigger phrases at the top. This interface is drag-and-drop, and you'll use it to build your conversation. You'll create a conversation tree with a series of messages, questions, and conditional branches.

1. Power Virtual Agents can identify various types of information (known as entities) from unstructured text in the response from the user. When you add a question to your conversation tree, you'll choose what type of information the bot should look for and extract from the response. Set the **Identify** field to **Multiple choice options**.

    > [![Screenshot highlighting the Choose information to identify menu, showing the Multiple choice options selection.](../media/choose-information.png)](../media/choose-information.png#lightbox)
