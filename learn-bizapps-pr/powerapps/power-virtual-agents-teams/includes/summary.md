In this lab, you created an internal chatbot that's embedded in Microsoft Teams. This bot can answer employee questions about Contoso Coffee swag and place orders on their behalf. You discovered that the chatbot in Teams automatically recognizes the signed-in user. Additionally, you learned how to connect your chatbot to your Dataverse for Teams table to retrieve data and create new requests on behalf of the user. Finally, you learned how to publish and share your bot with other team members and how to request admin approval to publish your bot for the whole organization.
