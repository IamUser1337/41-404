In this lab, you'll add the Microsoft Power Virtual Agents app to Microsoft Teams. Additionally, you'll create a chatbot for the employees of Contoso Coffee to get information about frequently asked questions for swag and to use the bot to request swag. The chatbot will be able to submit an asset request on behalf of the user, and you'll view the request in the same Microsoft Dataverse for Teams table that you created previously. 

- **Exercise 1** - Create a chatbot in Teams. Explore the Power Virtual Agents app for Teams and create a bot.

- **Exercise 2** - Personalize the greeting. Edit the greeting topic to set up how the bot introduces itself to a user.

- **Exercise 3** - Create a topic for the bot to answer common questions from employees about Contoso Coffeeâ€™s swag.

- **Exercise 4** - Create a flow by using the embedded flow experience. Set up the chatbot to interact with the Dataverse for Teams tables that you created previously so that the user can submit a request for swag by using the chatbot. To do so, you'll use the embedded flow experience inside the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams.

- **Exercise 5** - Publish and share your chatbot. Publish the bot so that you, others in your Team, and the organization can use it.
