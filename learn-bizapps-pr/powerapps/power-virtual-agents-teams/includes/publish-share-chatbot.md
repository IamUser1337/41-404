Now that you've finished editing and testing your bot, you're ready to publish it and test or use it in Teams.

## Task: Publish your bot and add it to the team

Your first task is to publish your bot and add it to the team.

1. Return to your Power Virtual Agents app through the left navigation bar and then open your chatbot for editing. Select the **Publish** icon in the left Power Virtual Agents navigation menu.

1. Select **Teams** and then go to the team that you've been working in for the labs. A message will display, indicating that the bot has been added to the team. Now, users can @mention the bot to talk to it directly in channel. You can begin the conversation with a bot in a new conversation or in the comments of an existing conversation. Whenever you want to respond to the bot, you should @mention the bot’s name.
