In this module, you learned about Figma and how you can use the Figma UI Kit to design and build a canvas app.

You also learned about the following concepts:

-   You can only convert compatible components of the Figma UI Kit to a canvas app. For other components, you can use images at design time.

-   The UI kit components are grouped under one of the following form factors:

    -   Phone

    -   Tablet

-   When a form component is part of the Figma design, you need to connect the form to a data source after it's converted to a canvas app to provide read or update capabilities.
