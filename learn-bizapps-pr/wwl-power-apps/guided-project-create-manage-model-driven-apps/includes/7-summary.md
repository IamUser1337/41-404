Contoso Real Estate sells and manages both commercial and residential real
estate properties. Customer information is stored in their current Dataverse
instance. They want to expand how they use Dataverse.

Since they currently have no centralized way of managing property listings,
Contoso Real Estate wants to use Dataverse and create a model-driven application
to keep track of property listings. By creating a model-driven application, Contoso Real Estate ensures they're
managing their listings effectively.

You applied your Dataverse and Power Apps skills to create an application that
meets Contoso Real Estateâ€™s needs.

-   You created custom tables with custom columns in Dataverse that
    hold information about each real estate property and showing.

-   You created forms and views that are used to display real estate property
    and showing information.

-   You built a model-driven application to manage properties and showings.

-   You used the model-driven application to capture customer, property, and showing
    details.

Congratulations on completing this Guided Project and validating your
Power Apps model-driven app skills!
