    
In this module, you'll create a data model in Dataverse and build out a
model-driven application to support a scenario for a fictional company. You'll
be provided with high-level specifications on the tables, columns, forms, and
views needed.

## Example scenario

You recently joined Contoso Real Estate as a Microsoft Power Platform consultant. You’ve
been asked to help the company’s IT team create a model-driven
application that will assist managers and listing agents. Currently, Contoso Real
Estate is using Dataverse to manage their customers, and they would like to
expand it to help manage the real estate properties they're selling.

## What you will be doing

-   Create custom tables and columns in Dataverse.

-   Build and modify forms and views to display data.

-   Create a model-driven application.

## Your main goal

By the end of this session, you have a working solution that validates your
knowledge of concepts covered in APL-7003: Create and manage model-driven apps
with Power Apps and Dataverse. If you haven't taken the assessment already, you might be
ready!
