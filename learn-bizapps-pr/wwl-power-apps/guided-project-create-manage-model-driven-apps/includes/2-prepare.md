You are creating multiple custom tables, columns, forms, and views and
putting them into a simple model-driven application. Here, we discuss the things
you need to get started.

## Project specification

Contoso Real Estate sells and manages both commercial and residential real
estate properties. Customer information is stored in their current Dataverse
instance. They want to expand how they use Dataverse.

Since they currently have no centralized way of managing property listings,
Contoso Real Estate wants to use Dataverse and create a model-driven application
to keep track of property listings. By creating a model-driven application, Contoso Real Estate ensures they're
managing their listings effectively.
