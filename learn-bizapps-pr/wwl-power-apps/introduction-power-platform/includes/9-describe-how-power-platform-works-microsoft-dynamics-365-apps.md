Dynamics 365 is a set of intelligent business applications that help organizations run their entire business and deliver greater results through predictive, AI-driven insights. From Finance and Intelligent Order Management to Sales and Customer Service, Dynamics 365 has various enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer engagement applications. 

There are many ways that the Power Platform works with Dynamics 365 products. First, all Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps are model-driven applications. These apps are based on a data model store within the Microsoft Dataverse. Model-driven applications are built using Power Apps. Components such as forms, views, charts, and dashboards are used to present data to end users.

Model-driven applications aren't the only component of the Power Platform used by Dynamics 365 applications. Other Power Platform tools and components used by Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps can include:

- **Power BI:** You can connect Power BI to Dynamics 365 applications to gain important insight into an organization. You can embed Power BI visualizations into Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

- **Power Automate:** Business process flows are the primary component in Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. These flows help guide you to get work done. For example, Dynamics 365 Sales includes a business process flow that guides sellers to begin with a lead and end with a closed sale.

- **Copilot Studio:** Intelligent copilots are becoming a regular part of customer support organizations. They can answer specific customer questions to reduce the workload for agents. Applications such as Dynamics 365 Customer Service can provide support across multiple channels to easily direct incoming phone calls, SMS, or Facebook messages to a copilot first. The copilot can then escalate to a live customer service agent working in Dynamics 365 Customer Service, as needed.

- **Power Pages:** Many organizations provide customers with self-support options where customers can access a portal and find answers to questions, engage with support, or even open new support tickets. Power Pages makes it easy for organizations to create externally facing sites that connect to Dataverse that customers can access.
