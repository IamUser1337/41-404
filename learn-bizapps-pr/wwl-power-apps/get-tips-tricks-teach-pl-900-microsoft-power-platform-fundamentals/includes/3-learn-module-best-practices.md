As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. With the increasing demand for everyone to become more technically skilled, the PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This may be your students' first introduction to Power Platform and this course serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. 
Before we begin, make sure you use the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum. It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module.
