Do you have inefficient or legacy business processes that you would like to modernize? Are you still moving information around using paper or even a shared Excel workbook? Do you want to be able to perform these business processes from different devices like PCs or mobile phones? Then you need Power Apps.

Power Apps is used to build apps that allow you to act on your data. Power Apps is great for replacing paper forms, legacy solutions, or just that spreadsheet that you and a few coworkers pass around. Using the skills and knowledge you already possess, you can build apps to interact with existing data by using more than 1,000 connectors. Once you build the apps on the web native Power Apps platform, they live in the cloud. The apps are easily shared and run on various platforms, including PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
