Power Apps is a no-code/low-code platform for building apps that builds off concepts like formulas in an Excel workbook such as SUM and TEXT. You can use Power Apps to build simple solutions like vehicle inspection forms and status reports, or complex business solutions for purchasing processes and inventory management. If you can envision an app to solve a business problem, then you can use your existing skills to build it. Although Power Apps can be used by virtually anyone, it also offers advanced functionality for seasoned developers to design complex applications with ease.

### Work with your data where it lives

When organizations modernize a paper-based process, there are likely systems with data you can use. With Power Apps, you have choices. With hundreds of connectors, you can easily connect to data, using the underlying data service and app platform Microsoft Dataverse or a multitude of online and on-premises data sources. 

Some common data sources include:

- Dataverse

- SharePoint

- Dynamics 365

- SQL Server and Azure SQL

- Office 365

You don't have to choose just one data source. Power Apps easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single app.

There are two primary application types that can be created with Power Apps: canvas and model-driven apps. Each application type has multiple features and functionality that helps support different scenarios. Letâ€™s look at each one in more detail.
