In this unit, you create a model-driven app by using one of the standard entities that are available in your Microsoft Power Apps environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This hands-on lab assumes that you have a Dataverse instance that you can work with. If you don't have an instance you can work with, you can obtain a 30-day Power Apps trial plan [here](/power-apps/maker/signup-for-powerapps).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you sign up for a Power Apps trial using your company email address, and your company is already using Power Apps, your trial will be added to your organization's current tenant.  If your current Microsoft account doesn't already have the necessary permissions, you may not be able to add tables to your trial. In these instances, you can sign up for a new trial account that doesn't use your work or school account. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW16PhH).
