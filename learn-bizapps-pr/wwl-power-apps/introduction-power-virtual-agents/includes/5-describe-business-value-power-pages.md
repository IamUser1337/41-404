Let’s look at an example where Power Pages can provide value to an organization. 

Contoso Real Estate is a property management and real estate company that sells and manages properties for clients. At any point, they can have hundreds of properties listed with them, and be working with just as many potential buyers. This volume makes it hard for their real estate agents to interact customers and provide them with the details they need. Many customers prefer to self-support. They want to have a centralized area where they can go to identify the properties currently listed and get answers to specific questions. 

By using Power Pages, Contoso Real estate can create and externally facing websites that provide clients with self-support options. 

For example, a dedicated property listing site would:

- **Improve customer interactions:** By providing customers with a web interface, they can manage their individual profiles. They can define the style of home they want, their preferred neighborhoods etc. Contoso can automatically send information to the customer when a new property that matches their criteria is listed. 

- **Simplify data operations:** By providing external customer with secure access to Contoso's property listings, Contoso can ensure that customers always have the most current information. 

- **Improve day to day operations:** As customers identify properties they are interested in, they can see if there are any open houses currently scheduled, or if they can request a showing. 

- **Build relationships with buyers:** Buyers with questions can engage in forums where they not only can ask questions of other buyers, but they can also engage with Contoso’s staff. This ensures that they're getting accurate information. 

All this can be built using a low code platform that lets you create targeted sites in no time.
