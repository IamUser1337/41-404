To add intelligence to your business:

1. **Choose an AI model type**: Use the model type that suits your business needs. Choose from a growing set of AI solutions.

2. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from the available options.

3. **Tailor your AI model**: Depending on the type of model, you can tweak custom models to optimize how your AI performs.

4. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic process. It teaches your AI model how to resolve your business problems based on your business data and tailoring. For example, the model can be trained to recognize your products on an image. When trained, your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction, or the list and number of objects detected in an image.

5. **Use insights from your AI model**: Use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs, even if you have no coding skills. For example, you can create a flow that automates document processing in Power Automate or an app in Power Apps that predicts whether a supplier is out of compliance.
