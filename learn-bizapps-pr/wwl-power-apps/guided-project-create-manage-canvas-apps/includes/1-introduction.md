Create your own data model and canvas app to support a scenario for a fictional company. You're provided high-level specifications on the custom tables, columns and canvas app needed to complete this project.

## Example scenario
You recently joined Contoso Pet Boarding as a Power Apps Consultant. Customers requested a way to submit booking requests for pet boarding without having to call the office. You were asked to create an app that allows customers to submit the information for their booking request for the office to review. You want to build an app that allows you to capture these booking requests and decide to accept or decline the booking.

## What you are doing
