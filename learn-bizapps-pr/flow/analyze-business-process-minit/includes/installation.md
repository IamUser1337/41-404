1.  Launch the app from where it was saved on your computer. If you're running the Windows 11 operating system, the desktop application should show up in your start menu.

1.  Sign in with the same email address that you used for process mining on the web and then authenticate by using your password.

1.  On the same screen, look for your process titled **Accounts Payable Refunds** and then select the **Default** view to open your process. For your process to show up, you should have created a process mining report in the Power Automate web portal.

After you've completed these steps, you should land on the following screen. Review the process map. It should look familiar; it's the same map that you previously viewed on the web.
