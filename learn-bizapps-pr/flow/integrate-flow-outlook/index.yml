title: Integrate desktop flows with Outlook connector in Power Automate for desktop
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  A connector is a proxy, or a wrapper around an API, that allows a service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate and other applications. It enables you to take advantage of prebuilt actions and triggers that help build your desktop and cloud flows. For example, Outlook.com connector allows you to complete various actions such as send email, schedule meetings, and add contacts. This module explains how to build on an existing gateway to integrate Microsoft Outlook with a desktop UI flow.
