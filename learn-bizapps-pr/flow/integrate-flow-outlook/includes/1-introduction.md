Creating a desktop flow enables you to automate tasks that use legacy applications on your desktop. This approach reduces the number of repetitive tasks that you perform daily, allowing you to redirect your focus toward creative or strategic tasks instead. However, manually initiating the trigger for your desktop application can be difficult, particularly if you're unavailable or incapable of doing so. Ideally, an event from your typical work process will trigger the start of your desktop flow. You can accomplish this task by building a cloud flow that's connected to a program, such as Microsoft Outlook, to trigger your process.
