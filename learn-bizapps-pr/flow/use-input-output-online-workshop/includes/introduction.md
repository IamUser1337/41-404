In the previous module, you created your first desktop flow that can automate the entering of a new invoice with fixed parameter values for Contoso Coffee shop. However, in reality, your automation should use real input variables instead of fixed values, and you'll likely need to capture real-time output from the automation running result as well.

In this module, you'll import a solution and learn how to create and use input and output parameters.
