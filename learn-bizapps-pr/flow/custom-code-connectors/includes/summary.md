By including custom code as part of a custom connector definition, you'll implement a wide range of transformations, on the requests and responses from the network services. Implementing the entire logic for a connector operation is possible without calling a network service. For example, reformatting data from one format to another or processing a regular expression can only be implemented by using the custom code feature. 

In this module, you learned how to create a Script class and the required **ExecuteAsync** method to implement custom code. You learned how to manage the operations processed by the custom code. Additionally, you learned how to use the context object and associated helper methods when processing an operation. You should consider implementing custom code in a connector when your transformation requirements can be implemented only by using policy templates.
