  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: When you create custom code for a custom connector operation, what is the ExecuteAsync method expected to do? 
    choices: 
    - content: Transform the output only. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You can transform the input and output in this method.
    - content: Transform the input and output along with forwarding the request to the network. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The ExecuteAsync method has full ability to transform the input and output and decide if the network is called.
    - content: Transform the input only. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You can transform the input and output in this method. 
    - content: Bypass the API security. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Calling the network from the ExecuteAsync method would still be subject to any API security mechanisms.
  - content: How many custom code classes can you upload and set up? 
    choices: 
    - content: One for each operation that’s defined on the connector 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Only one Script class that’s implementing custom code is supported.
    - content: Up to three classes
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Only one Script class that’s implementing custom code is supported.
    - content: Only one class 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The one script class must handle any operation that’s set up to use custom code.
    - content: Depends on the type of security that’s set up for the connector 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Only one Script class that’s implementing custom code is supported, regardless of the type of security that’s set up. 
  - content: You’ve added a new operation to your custom connector, and your custom code transformations aren’t being applied. What should you do? 
    choices: 
    - content: Check in the Code Details section of the custom connector definition to ensure that your operation is set up to implement the custom code. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Each operation must be enabled, or if none is specified, all will implement the custom code.
    - content: Reimport the connector definition. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Reimporting the connector definition doesn't resolve the issue.
    - content: Use the Microsoft Power Platform CLI to enable the new operation. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Using the Microsoft Power Platform CLI to enable the new operation doesn't resolve the issue.
    - content: Check the Swagger editor. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Checking the Swagger editor doesn’t help resolve your issue.
