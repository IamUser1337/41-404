  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: When are input/output variables defined?
    choices: 
    - content: Input variables are defined before the flow, and output variables are defined along the process of the flow. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This statement defines when input and output variables are defined. 
    - content: Output variables are defined before the flow, while input variables are defined during the flow. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Input variables are defined before the flow, and output variables are defined along the process of the flow. 
    - content: Both are defined before the flow.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Input variables are defined before the flow, and output variables are defined along the process of the flow. 
    - content: Both are defined during the flow.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Input variables are defined before the flow, and output variables are defined along the process of the flow. 
  - content: When you need to pass parameters from a cloud flow into a desktop flow, where do you define these values? 
    choices: 
    - content: Desktop recorder 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The desktop recorder is for capturing screen activities.
    - content: Input/output variables 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Input/output variables allow the maker to establish parameters that a cloud flow can send. In addition, you can use output variables to send data back to cloud flows.
    - content: Run next action
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Your flow uses the Run next action command to initiate the next action. 
    - content: Action Pane
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You'd use the Action Pane to bring connectors, triggers, and other actions into a desktop flow.
  - content: Which one of the following actions allows you to use Invoice ID in downstream desktop flow actions or is required to return the value to a cloud flow? 
    choices: 
    - content: Increase variable 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You'll use the increase variable action to increase or decrease a variable in your flow. 
    - content: Set variable
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You can set an output type of variable that will capture the Invoice ID. It will allow you to use the Invoice ID in downstream processes or to send back to a cloud flow. 
    - content: Start recorder 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You'll use the start recorder function to record screen activity.
    - content: Create a new list 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The create a new list action will create a new list to store extra elements for use in your flow.
