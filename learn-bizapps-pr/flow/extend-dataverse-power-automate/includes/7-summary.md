Using the Dataverse connector, you can build cloud flows to create automations on your Dataverse table data. The connector offers the ability to perform basic operations, including the ability to create, modify, delete, and query data. In this module, you explored the other actions on the connector. You can upload and download the column binary contents using the file and image actions. You can use  **Perform a bound action** and **Perform an unbound action** to invoke custom logic as part of your cloud flow. In Dataverse environments where you configure the search capabilities, you can use the search action to perform searches for data across multiple configured tables. Using the changeset action, you can combine multiple modifications of Dataverse table rows into a single transaction to ensure all are completed or rolled back.
