## Learning objectives

- Work with files and images stored in Dataverse columns

- Perform bound and unbound operations

- Search Dataverse data from a cloud flow

- Use changesets to create or modify Dataverse data in a transaction

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of building cloud flows with Power Automate

- Basic understanding of using the Dataverse connector

- Access to an environment with Dataverse with sample apps installed if you want to do the included exercises
