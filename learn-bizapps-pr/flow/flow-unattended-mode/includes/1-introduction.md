Some business processes require supervision or input that's impossible or risky to automate. For example, approval to implement a financial transaction of significant value. However, you can fully automate other processes that don't require human oversight or are inconvenient or impractical to constantly monitor. 

This module demonstrates the solution for these scenarios by explaining how to run your UI and API flows in **unattended** mode.
