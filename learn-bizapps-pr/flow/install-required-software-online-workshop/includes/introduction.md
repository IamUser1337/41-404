## Requirements

The requirements for this lab are as follows:

- Microsoft Power Automate for each user with attended Robotic Process Automation (RPA) plan trial

- Microsoft Power Apps Developer Plan

- Microsoft Exchange mailbox

## Prerequisite: Install required software on your computer

This lab guides you through the following steps:

- Install the Power Automate for desktop app and the required extensions.

- Register your machine.

- Install the Contoso Invoice app.

> [!NOTE]
> Follow the subsequent steps if you haven't already installed the previously mentioned software. If you have the Power Automate for desktop app already installed and your machine is registered, check if you're running on the latest version of Power Automate for desktop. If not, we recommend that you update to the latest by following the subsequent installation instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've previously installed the legacy V1 UI flows exe or SoftoMotive RPA software, we recommend that you uninstall/remove all browser extensions from your browser first (such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

> [!NOTE]
> Check machine requirements to ensure that you sign in to your machine with an account that has permission to install software, preferably an account with local administrator rights. At minimum, the machine should have a Windows 10 Pro operating system (or Windows Server 2019/2016 operating system), Net 4.7.2, and an Edge (chromium) or Chrome browser installed. The machine can be a physical machine or a virtual machine; however, you might experience performance issues on a slow virtual machine, so we recommend that you select a high performance virtual machine.
