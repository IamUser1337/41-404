Organizations deal with important data like financial records, secret business information that keeps them ahead, and sometimes, personal stuff like credit card numbers, health records, and social security information. When you create solutions with Microsoft Power Platform and let people use them, it's a significant problem if they accidentally share this data with the wrong folks. That's where Data Loss Protection (DLP) policies come to the rescue. They help organizations spot, keep an eye on, and automatically safeguard their sensitive data.

Over the course of this module you'll learn:

-   How DLP policies protect business and sensitive data from being leaked

-   DLP policy configurations for Microsoft 365 and Dynamics environments

-   Using Power Automate for directional data governance

-   How to manage HTTP and customer connectors

Every organization has different needs when it comes to governance. Approach the following sections as options and implement the solution that best aligns with your requirements.
