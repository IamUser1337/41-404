In the previous module, you created a cloud flow that triggers automatically whenever a new invoice email arrives in the inbox that Contoso Coffee shop uses to receive invoice files from different vendors. After the cloud flow triggers, it also runs a desktop flow on your machine to enter the invoice detail into the invoice management app on the desktop.

However, in the previous module, you didn't use the real data from the invoice file that was attached in the incoming email. In this module, you'll learn how to use AI Builder of Microsoft Power Automate (a low-code AI technology) to understand and automatically pull data information from the email attachment invoice file. Additionally, you'll learn how to use the data from the invoice file as inputs for the desktop flow to use when it enters details in the management app system.
