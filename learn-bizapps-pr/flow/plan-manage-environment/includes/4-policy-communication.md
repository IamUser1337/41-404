Many organizations have a set of rules for how employees should use company computers and network devices. Employees and contractors agree to follow these rules when they use IT tools as they're meant to be used. It's a way to make sure everyone is on the same page. Including guidelines for using Microsoft Power Platform apps and flows in this policy is a great way to set clear expectations for the platform and its users.

Education is another way to get the message across. When organizations hold training sessions for Microsoft Power Platform products, it's a perfect time to talk about the rules and what's expected.

Just like organizations invest in teaching employees about cybersecurity, they should also invest in educating app makers if they want them to use Microsoft Power Platform responsibly.

You can also use automation, like the Microsoft Power Platform Center of Excellence (COE) Starter Kit. It has a welcome email that can be sent when someone creates a new app or flow. This email is an excellent opportunity to share policy info and include a link to an intranet article with more details. It's all about making sure everyone knows the rules and follows them.
