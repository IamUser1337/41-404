1.  Provide your sign-in user and password information.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If you're uncertain of what to enter in the **Domain and username** field, you can use the **Command Prompt** window (open Windows **Start** menu, enter **CMD**, and then press the **Enter** key). Enter the **whoami** command and press the **Enter** key to locate the domain and username. Fill in the textbox with **USERDOMAIN\USERNAME**.

	If this account isn't a domain account, then use the **Set computer** command to look for the computer name. Fill in the text with **COMPUTERNAME\USERNAME**.

	> [!TIP]
	> To make sure that you have the correct sign-in credentials, try signing out of the computer and using the username/password combination to determine if you can successfully sign in to this computer.

	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> The account that you plan to use must have local admin rights on your machine.

1. Select **Enter an invoice** from the **Desktop flow** dropdown menu.

1. From the **Run Mode** dropdown menu, select **Attended (runs when you're signed in)**. This mode runs the desktop flow while you're signed in to the same machine. Unattended mode is for running automation on the server machines without users needing to sign in.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the solutions.](../media/solutions.png)](../media/solutions.png#lightbox)

1. After clicking on the solution, select the **Add existing** drop-down menu at the top of the page. Then select **Automation** and then **Cloud flow**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the add existing steps.](../media/add-existing-automation.png)](../media/add-existing-automation.png#lightbox)

1. The Add existing cloud flows dialogue box will pop up. Select the **Outside Dataverse** tab in the box. Then select the flow **Manual trigger desktop flow to enter invoice** and finally, select **Add**.
