Now you're ready to use Microsoft Power Automate desktop flows to start automating some processes to help increase productivity and efficiency. You'll complete the following tasks in this lab:

-   Get familiar with Power Automate desktop flows.

-   Create a new solution.

-   Create a new desktop flow.

-   Record actions that are performed in the desktop-installed Contoso Invoicing application.

-   Perform a test run of the new desktop flow.

## Prerequisites

This lab builds on the initial setup lab (Lab 1). Ensure that you've completed all tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because you'll be recording actions that are performed in your UI in this lab, we recommend that you view the lab instructions on a separate device or in a printout. You can still complete the lab while using the instructions during UI action recording, but you'll need to perform extra work to cut the recorded actions of viewing the instructions from the desktop flow.

Also, make sure that you review the [known operating system requirements and limitations for desktop flows](/power-automate/desktop-flows/requirements/?azure-portal=true). 

## About solutions

This lab introduces the concept of solutions. Developers use solutions to write, package, and maintain units of software that extend Microsoft Dataverse. For example, developers would deploy the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service apps by using solutions. Customizers and developers distribute software through solutions so that organizations can use Microsoft Dataverse to install and uninstall the business functionality that the solution defines. For more information, see [Introduction to solutions](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/introduction-solutions/?azure-portal=true).
