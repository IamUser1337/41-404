## Key concepts in Process Mining

At its core, process mining is about extracting valuable insights from transaction logs available in various information systems. It helps organizations discover, monitor, and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs readily available in today's systems.

Unlike traditional analysis methods, process mining goes beyond surface-level observation. It's a bridge between data science and process management, leveraging the wealth of data generated by everyday business operations. By analyzing this data, process mining provides a clear, unbiased view of how processes actually operate, uncovering inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization.

**Data Extraction:** The journey of process mining begins with data. It relies on extracting event logs from information systems like ERP, CRM, or BPM systems. These logs record the sequence of activities in business processes, along with timestamps and other relevant information.

**Process Discovery:** One of the most exciting aspects of process mining is process discovery. This involves using algorithms to create process models from event logs. Unlike manual process mapping, which can be time-consuming and prone to bias, process discovery automatically generates a visual representation of how processes are actually being executed.

**Conformance Checking:** Once you have a process model, the next step is conformance checking. This is where the process mining tool compares the discovered process model with a predefined ideal process. Conformance checking helps identify deviations and nonconformance issues, such as skipped steps or actions executed out of order.

**Process Enhancement:** With insights from process discovery and conformance checking, businesses can move to the process enhancement stage. Here, process mining tools suggest modifications and improvements to optimize the processes. This might involve eliminating bottlenecks, automating tasks, or redesigning certain steps for better efficiency.

**Continuous Monitoring and Analysis:** Process mining isn't a one-time activity. For ongoing benefits, continuous monitoring is crucial. By regularly analyzing the process logs, organizations can keep track of how changes impact the process efficiency and quickly identify new issues or areas for improvement.

**Advanced Analytics:** Beyond basic process mapping and monitoring, process mining can integrate advanced analytical techniques like predictive analytics and machine learning. This allows businesses to forecast future process behaviors, anticipate potential problems, and make informed decisions to optimize processes.

## Process Mining's role in hyperautomation 

Gartner, Inc., a prominent technological research firm, describes **hyperautomation** as the use of multiple technologies to rapidly identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and automate as many business processes as possible. Examples of these technologies include:

- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Robotic process automation (RPA)
- Machine learning
- Low-code/no-code software

Gartner anticipates that, by 2024, organizations can potentially reduce their operational costs by 30 percent if they combine hyperautomation with process redesign. Therefore, Power Automate's process mining capability is a vital tool that empowers businesses to quickly pinpoint automation opportunities. It helps kickstart their hyperautomation journey by analyzing their processes to reveal activities that can be automated to boost efficiency and generate cost savings.
