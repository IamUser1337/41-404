title: Integrate with Microsoft Teams to get approvals - Online workshop
summary: |
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]
  Integrate with Teams and build on the automation thatâ€™s implemented in previous modules to process invoices automatically. Now, users don't need to manually check email or enter data step by step. The automation doesn't send payments to vendors automatically. Instead, a human supervisor approves and confirms that the invoice is real and ready for payment before automation moves to the next step. Power Automate provides seamless, built-in human approval mechanisms that you can use.
