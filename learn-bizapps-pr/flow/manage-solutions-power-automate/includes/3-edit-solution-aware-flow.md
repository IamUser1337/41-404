Editing a solution-aware app, flow, and table requires you to first select the items from your solution.

1. Sign in to Power Apps, select **Solutions**, and then select **Volunteer Request**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Select Solutions and Volunteer Request to access your solution.](../media/new-volunteer.svg)](../media/new-volunteer.svg#lightbox)

   You should see all your apps, flows, and tables.
