In this module, you learned about AI Builder and how you can use it to add intelligence to your apps and automations. You also explored the Create text with GPT model in AI Builder and how you can use it to generate text. Additionally, you learned how to use the Create text with GPT model in Power Automate by building a flow that:

- Extracts information from an email that a customer has sent requesting a real estate showing.

- Sends a message to a Teams channel with the extracted information.

It's important to remember that AI-generated content can be factually incorrect, inappropriate, or biased. We strongly recommend that you institute a practice of inserting [human oversight](/ai-builder/azure-openai-textgen?azure-portal=true#human-oversight) in workflows that use AI-generated text before it's posted or used anywhere. You can do so by adding an approval step to your flow.
