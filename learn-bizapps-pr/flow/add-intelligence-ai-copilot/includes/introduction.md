AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that helps you improve your business performance by automating processes and predicting outcomes. By using AI Builder, you can quickly bring AI to your apps and flows that connect to your business data. It works with your data that's stored in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various Microsoft cloud data sources, such as SharePoint, OneDrive, or Azure.

AI models that you create in AI Builder can help provide intelligence to enhance your business. AI Builder simplifies the AI creation experience because people with any level of technical skill can add AI capabilities to their apps and flows without writing code. Additionally, AI Builder provides prebuilt AI models, where you don't need to gather data to build and train the model. You can start using the intelligence right away.
