The **Create text with GPT** model in AI Builder is a text generation model that's powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is built on generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology. GPT models are a type of natural language processing model.

GPT models are trained on a large body of content to generate human-like text from a prompt. When you combine them with workflow automation, you can use AI models like GPT to automate various tasks.

For example, you can build workflows to automatically generate drafts of emails, customer service responses, and product descriptions. You can also use workflows to generate scripts that allow customer service agents to respond quickly to customer inquiries.

When creating prompts for the Create text with GPT model in AI Builder, you need to remember that a prompt has two parts: 

- **Instruction** - Tells the model what it should do.

- **Context** - The information that the model needs to follow the instruction.

In an automation task, the instruction is constant and dynamic content provides the context.
