Apart from the **ID** property, custom forms offer a wide variety of other properties for each element. In this section, you'll use some of these properties to customize the previously created form. 

Before customizing any specific element, select the blank workspace in the custom form designer to access the main dialog's properties.

In this example, the minimum height of the dialog is set to 300 pixels. As a result, the form contains some unused space. To improve its appearance, set the **Vertical content alignment** property to **Center**.

Additionally, add a title for the custom form dialog and populate a URL of an image to use as a background.

Now, you can visually divide the date of birth from the name and last name fields. To achieve this result, select the date input element, set the **Spacing** property to **Medium**, and enable the **Separator** option.
