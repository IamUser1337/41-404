Interacting with users is a critical part of most attended desktop flows, as many scenarios require user input or need to display information on the screen.

Desktop flows provide various message boxes actions that allow you to prompt users to provide data or/and display information.

Although these actions are ideal for handling a limited amount of data peruse, they can't handle scenarios where multiple data inputs are required.

The best candidate to automate these scenarios is the **Display custom form** action. This action enables you to create custom forms that contain multiple input elements in a single dialog.
