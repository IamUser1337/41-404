With Power Automate, you can build automated cloud workflows with a trigger and multiple actions. A trigger is an event that starts a cloud flow. The Dataverse connector supports four triggers that allow the starting of flows based on Dataverse data events.

Triggers on the Dataverse connector are as follows:

- **When a row is added, modified or deleted** - Use this trigger to start a flow when a row is added, modified, or deleted in a Dataverse table. For example, when you add a new row to the Project table, the system should run a flow.

- **When an action is performed** - This trigger occurs when a Dataverse action completes. As a result, the system triggers flows from custom business events that you define. For example, you could create an **EmployeeOnboarded** event and then use it to trigger flows.

- **When a flow step is run from a business process flow** - With this trigger, you can start a flow when someone selects the **Run Flow** button in a business process flow step. For example, in a Microsoft Power Apps model-driven app that uses a business process flow, you could create a step that starts a flow to get a manager's approval.

- **When a row is selected** - This trigger starts a flow when a user in a Power Apps model-driven app selects a row and runs the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the **When a row is selected** trigger is being upgraded from the Dataverse (Legacy) connector to the newer Dataverse connector. Until it's available on the new connector with other triggers, you need to use the legacy connector to use this trigger.

Each trigger has different options that you need to set up. Some triggers have advanced options that provide extra control over the behaviors of the trigger. The rest of this topic highlights some of the more common options that you can set up.

## When a row is added, modified or deleted

To use the **When a row is added, modified or deleted** trigger, you need to set up the change type, table, and scope options on the trigger. All other configuration is optional.

### Change type

Use the **Change type** trigger to set up one or more data row events that you want to trigger the flow. For example, you can choose to have the flow run when a row is added, modified, or deleted or combinations of these actions. These data row events trigger the flow after the change to the row occurs in the Dataverse environment.

If you add or modify the change type, the current Dataverse table row is available as output for you to use in subsequent steps from the dynamic content area. If you delete the change type, only the row ID of the Dataverse row is available.

If you trigger your flow on multiple change types, and if you need conditional logic depending on the type, then you can use the following expression to get the change type that triggered the flow. The SdkMessage property contains create, update, or delete.

```
triggerBody()?['SdkMessage'] 
```

If you complete multiple updates for a row, your flow might trigger for each update, even if the row column values don't change. This situation occurs because you completed the update on the row multiple times. The logic in your flow must take this factor into consideration.

### Table name

You can choose the table name from the full list, or you can filter the list by starting to type the table name. Table names aren't presented in alphabetical order, so using the filter can be helpful in environments with a large number of tables.

### Scope

When you create a Dataverse table, you specify the type of row ownership. The organization can own the rows, or a user or team can own them.

You can use the scope option to specify which rows qualify to trigger the flow based on who owns the row that's being modified. If the table row ownership is organization, the only option for scope is organization. For tables that allow user or team ownership, you can choose any of the following options for scope:

- **Organization** - This option is the default. Any user who owns a row and modifies it can trigger your flow. Additionally, anyone who modifies organization-owned tables can trigger your flow.

- **User** - This option is the most limiting; your flow only runs if you own the modified row.

- **Business Unit** - This option triggers your flow if anyone in your business unit owns the modified row. For example, consider a scenario where you're in the Marketing business unit with 16 users. Whenever any of those 16 users completes an action, they could trigger your flow if anyone else in the business unit owned the modified row.

- **Parent: Child Business Unit** - This option includes any child business unit users in determining whose actions can trigger your flow. Therefore, if the Marketing business unit had child business units of Marketing - USA and Marketing - EMEA, the system includes those users in determining if your flow should run.

Organization and user are the most common configurations. Organization scope is best if you're creating a flow for all users. User scope is best if you're creating your own personal automation and want to minimize random or irrelevant data that other users enter.

While you could set up scope to include more data rows than you have privileges to read, your flow is only triggered for the rows that you have privileges to read.

In addition to the required choices, the trigger has the following commonly used options:

- Select columns

- Filter rows

- Run as

### Select columns

The **Select columns** option only applies when you set the change type to include modified rows. You can provide a list of table columns that, if they're included in modifying the data row, your flow runs.

This option is a helpful feature in reducing the runs of your flows. For example, if you only want to run a flow if the Contact table’s First name and Last name columns are in a modification, you would set the **Select columns** option as follows:

```
firstname,lastname
```
It's also important to use this feature if your flow intends to use an update row action later to update columns on the row that triggered the flow. To avoid an infinite loop, make sure that you don't include the columns that you update in the **Select columns** option.

### Filter rows

Use the **Filter rows** option to filter the rows that trigger your flow based on the values of the row's columns. For example, you could filter the Project table rows to include only over-budget rows. While adding a condition check to your flow actions could accomplish the same task, it's less efficient than using a filter rows expression.

You can specify filter rows by using an OData expression. The flow runs only when the system evaluates the expression to be true after you save the change in Dataverse.

```
contoso_amountoverbudget gt 10000

```

This module explores common OData expressions later in the querying data topic. 

### Run as

By using the **run as** option, you can set each Dataverse action in the flow to be performed by using the context of a user other than the flow owner. The flow owner must have the **Act on Behalf of Another User** Dataverse privilege. The delegate security role includes this privilege by default, but you can add it to other security roles.

You can set the **run as** feature with the following options:

- **Flow owner** - The user who created the flow.

- **Row owner** - The user who owns the Dataverse row that triggered the flow. If a team owns a row, then this option falls back to run as the flow owner.

- **Modifying user** - The user who took the action on the Dataverse row, causing the flow to be triggered or modified.

For each Dataverse action that you want to run as a different user, select **Use invoker’s connection** on the action's **Settings** tab.

Consider the following example. John creates a flow that adds tasks to new Project table rows. If Mary creates a new Project row, the flow runs and the system adds new tasks. Afterward, John can view these newly added tasks.

If John changes the **run as** option to **modifying user** and then changes the **add row** feature of the tasks to **Use invoker's connection**, then the task rows show Mary as the creator instead of John.
