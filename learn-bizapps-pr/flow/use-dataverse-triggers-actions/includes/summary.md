With the Microsoft Dataverse connector, you can build Power Automate cloud flows that work with Dataverse data. By using the connector's triggers, you can run your flow based on data, business events, or on-demand from Power Apps model-driven applications. In this module, you learned how to set up the Dataverse triggers to optimize your flows to run only for the data events that you need.

Additionally, you learned how to: 

- Use the connector's actions to work with Dataverse data as part of the logic of your cloud flow. 

- Compose your query by using OData and FetchXML criteria styles. 

- Use the add row, update row, and relate and unrelate data. 

- Create and modify Dataverse data and relate it together by using the table's relationships.

In the exercise, you built a cloud flow that used what you learned about Dataverse triggers and actions.
