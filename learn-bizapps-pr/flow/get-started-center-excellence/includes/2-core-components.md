Core components are set up to sync all your resources from Microsoft Power Platform into tables to get more visibility into the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. The core components contain assets that are relevant to citizen developers, makers, administrators, and security.

The following information is available for each app:

- Display name
- App ID
- Environment
- Owner
- Created on
- Modified on
- Published on
- Last launched on (if collecting audit log information is configured)
- App plan classification (standard, premium, extended)
- Shared users
- Shared groups
- Shared with tenant (yes/no)
- App type (canvas, model-driven, SharePoint form app)
- App orphaned

PowerApps Connector represents a standard or custom connector. The following information is available for each connector:

- Connector ID
- Display name
- Icon background color and URI
- Is custom connector (yes/no)
- Maker (for custom connectors)
- Publisher
- Tier (standard/premium)

Maker represents a user who creates an app, flow, custom connector, or environment. The following information is available for each maker (retrieved from Microsoft 365 user profiles):

- Display name
- ID
- Email (user principal name)
- City
- Country/region
- Department
- Job title
- Office
- Number of apps (rollup)
- Number of flows (rollup)

Audit Log represents session details for Power Apps. The following information is available for each audit log entry:

- Operation (launched app, deleted app, deleted flow)
- App/cloud flow ID
- User city, country/region, department, job title (from Microsoft 365)
- Audit log event time

With Power BI reports, you can get a holistic view of Dataverse data with visualizations and insights for Environments, Apps, Flows, Connector, Connection Reference, Maker, and Audit Log tables.
