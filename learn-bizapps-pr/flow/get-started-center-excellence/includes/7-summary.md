A Center of Excellence (CoE) is like a powerhouse for creativity and progress. It brings together people who share similar business goals to exchange ideas, knowledge, and success stories, all while ensuring things run smoothly with consistent standards and rules.

Now, let's talk about the kit. It's important to know that the kit isn't the whole CoE package. Managing a CoE isn't just about having tools; it's about having the right people, clear communication, and well-defined plans and processes. The tools in this kit are like helpful tools in a toolbox, but each organization needs to carefully design their own CoE to fit their unique needs and preferences.

The building blocks used in this kit, such as Dataverse, admin APIs, and connectors, are fully supported. The kit provides examples of how to use these building blocks effectively. Customers and the community can use and customize these features to create admin and governance systems that work best for their organizations.
