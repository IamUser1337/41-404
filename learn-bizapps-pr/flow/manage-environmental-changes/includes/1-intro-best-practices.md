Previous modules of this learning path discussed the role of environments, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and some of the tools that you can use to manage these features. This module explains how administrators can prepare for making governance changes through

Change management matters because it helps avoid problems when we make changes to Microsoft Power Platform. Sometimes, when we change things without warning, it can create confusion or disappointment for the people using these apps.

For instance, think about someone who's created a flow that's important for their work. They wouldn't be happy if a change in a policy breaks their flow. So, it's a good idea to understand what tools people are using and who's using them before making any changes. This way, the person in charge can feel more confident about the changes they're making.

But here's the cool part: Change management isn't about stopping people from doing great stuff. It's about finding the folks who are doing amazing things with Microsoft Power Platform. When we spot these champs, we can figure out how to support them and help the whole organization do even better.

The following units discuss different tools and techniques that you can use to gain insights that will help an administrator manage change in their environments.
