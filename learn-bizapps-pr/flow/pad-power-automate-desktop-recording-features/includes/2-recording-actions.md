The recorder is used to assist users in the development of flows. Using the recorder, users can perform tasks manually, and Power Automate for desktop will automatically generate actions to mimic their behavior.

The recorder can be used to automate two different kinds of applications:

-   Windows and desktop applications

-   Web pages and web applications

When it records desktop applications, the recorder generates UI automation, mouse, and keyboard actions. Likewise, the recording of web applications generates web browser-related actions. Both groups of actions can be generated in the same recording session.

## Accessing and using the recorder

To record a flow, select **Recorder** in the toolbar of the flow designer.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the recorder button in the flow designer.](../media/flow-designer-recorder-button.png)](../media/flow-designer-recorder-button.png#lightbox)

When the recorder dialog is launched, select **Record** to start recording.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the recorder window.](..\media\recorder-window.png)

This dialog is where a preview of the recorded actions will appear during the recording. To suspend the recording, select **Pause**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the recorded steps in the recorder window.](..\media\recorded-actions.png)

When the recording is completed, select **Finish** to convert the recorded steps to Power Automate for desktop actions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the generated actions in the flow designer.](../media/generated-actions.png)](../media/generated-actions.png#lightbox)

When the recorder is used, you'll see the **Start of autogenerated actions using the recorder** text at the beginning of the flow and the **End of autogenerated actions using the recorder** at the end.
