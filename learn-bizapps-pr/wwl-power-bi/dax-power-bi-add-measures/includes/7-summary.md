In this module, you learned that Power BI measures are either implicit or explicit. Implicit measures are automatic behaviors that are supported by visuals, while explicit measures use DAX formulas that summarize model data.

Explicit measures are important because they allow you to create complex DAX formulas to achieve the precise calculations that your report visuals need. While you learned to create simple and compound measures in this module, in later modules you'll learn to create more powerful measures by using filter modification functions and iterator functions.
