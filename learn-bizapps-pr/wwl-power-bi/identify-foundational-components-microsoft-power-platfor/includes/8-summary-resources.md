Microsoft Power Platform provides administrators, citizens, and professional developers with various tools and utilities to make the most of their Power Platform solutions. 

Power Platform administration involves managing Power Platform environments, which are used to store and share business data, apps, and flows. Each environment is created under a Microsoft Entra ID tenant and is bound to a geographic location. Administrators can use the Power Platform admin center to manage environments, configure settings, and access analytics, billing, and support. In addition to the admin center, there are other maker portals available for managing specific components of Power Platform, such as Power Apps and Power Automate. Power Platform also provides features for security and governance, including data loss prevention policies and compliance offerings. Microsoft Dataverse is a cloud-based solution that structures data and business logic for interconnected applications. It incorporates security, logic, data, and storage into a central point and powers Microsoft Dynamics 365 solutions. Dataverse supports large data sets and complex data models, and tables can be customized and related to each other. Business logic can be applied using business rules, and dataflows can be used for data preparation and integration. Connectors are used to connect Power Platform components to different data sources, allowing for data integration and functionality extension.
