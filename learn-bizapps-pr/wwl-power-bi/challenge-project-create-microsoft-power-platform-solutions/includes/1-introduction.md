Unit 1: Introduction (5 mins)
=============================

In this module, you create your own solutions to the stated problems. This
workshop is open-ended by design.

In this workshop you're analyzing and architecting solutions based on a series
of sheets in a planning workbook. You're choosing the company to use, so weâ€™ve
given you detail based on industry standards. **Your chosen company may or may
not exactly fit the guidelines here, use creative license to evaluate and
architect solutions for the new department they are planning**.

You'll select a public company you're not familiar with in the
financial services industry and use what you learn to start discovery of that
company using public sources.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise is based on financial services but could fairly easily be applied to almost any service-oriented use case.

-   Complete the project workbook

**What is the main goal?**

By the end of this challenge, you have a project workbook with your
decisions for the solution you're architecting.
