Unit 3: Conceptualize the design (180 mins)
===========================================

*Complete the Architecture Diagram, Business Apps Used, and Fit Gap tabs in the
Project Worksheet.*

You are building a solution for a new Customer Retention Group that is being
formed at your client to handle all customer exit requests across all divisions
of the company. These customers are transferred to the Retention Group once they
make it known they are trying to close their accounts. The retention groupâ€™s
goal is to take the transferred customer that wants to leave and retain them as
a customer by offering a discount, an alternative service, or even settle an
unresolved complaint.

-   Each division of the company was an independent company at one time and were
    acquired through acquisition and therefore have their own independent
    applications for managing their customers.

-   The new system only knows about the customer when transferred via an
    integration that will bring in the relevant information to the new solution.
    Your project includes establishing this integration.

-   Accounts are assigned to the retention group staff based on their
    current workload, they have a list of options they can offer the
    customer such as a discount or another service.

-   Once resolved, the originating system is advised of the resolution to
    implement it for the customer.

-   The assigned staff owns the problem until resolved.

-   Customers should be able to view their cancel request status via a website.

-   After a complaint is resolved the complaint information stays in the
    system for 28 days following resolution. After that it must be removed.

-   Any complaint offering a discount more than 50% of the original contract
    price must be approved by the retention group manager.

*Complete the Data Model, Apps Architecture, Automation, and Security Model tabs
in the Project Worksheet.*

Using what you know about the customer and the industry build a high-level data
model. Include the core tables and their relationships.

Review each of the other tabs named here. Evaluate the questions asked and
provide your answers.

*Complete the ALM tab in the Project Worksheet.*  
Identify how ALM is performed and what Power Platform environments will be
required. Create a high-level diagram illustrating the different environments
and your promotion path between them.

Use the following to influence your ALM strategy:

-   You have a team of five who are building the solution, two of the team
    members are code developers.

-   Two people have been assigned to support testing.

-   Each system integrating to send your system complaints have at least
    one tester who will test the integration with your new solution.
