 title: Modify DAX filter context in Power BI Desktop models
 description: By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe filter context, which is used to evaluate measure formulas. You'll then learn why some calculations need to modify filter context and that it can be achieved by using the CALCULATE function. Additionally, you'll learn how to configure the CALCULATE function with filters and filter modifiers.
