  questions:
  - content: "What is the common flow of activity in Power BI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a report in the Power BI service, share it to Power BI mobile, and interact with it in Power BI Desktop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The common flow of activity in Power BI doesn't start with creating a report in the Power BI service. Commonly, the flow begins by creating a report in Power BI Desktop."
    - content: "Create a report in Power BI Desktop, share it to the Power BI service, and interact with reports in the service and Power BI Mobile."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Power BI service lets you view and interact with reports and dashboards, but doesn't let you shape data."
    - content: "Create a report in Power BI mobile, share it to Power BI Desktop, and interact with reports in the Power BI service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't bring data directly into Power BI Mobile. You connect to data and create reports in Power BI Desktop."
  - content: "Which of the following are building blocks of Power BI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tiles and visualizations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tiles and visualizations are the starting points for dashboards and reports, but depend on semantic models."
    - content: "Semantic models and visualizations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Without a semantic model, you can't create visualizations, and reports are made up of visualizations."
    - content: "Semantic models and reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a semantic model is the first step, you can't create reports without visualizations."
  - content: "What is a collection of reports and dashboards called in Power BI?"
    choices:
    - content: "The canvas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The canvas is the area in the center of Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service, and is blank until you create visuals or reports."
    - content: "Scheduled refresh."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scheduled refresh lets you automatically update data for semantic models, but is not a collection of ready-made visuals."
    - content: "An app."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An app is a collection of ready-made visuals, pre-arranged in dashboards and reports. You can get apps that connect to many online services from the AppSource."
