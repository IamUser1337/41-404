In this module, we identified the different types of Copilot features available in Power BI. It’s imperative to properly prepare your underlying semantic model in order to have an effective experience using Copilot. Once you’ve prepared the model and published it to the Power BI service, you can create a report from the semantic model and access Copilot.

Copilot can help you better understand the different visuals and allow you to choose which will be most effective for your report. Copilot can also help you understand how to ask the right questions from your data to gain necessary and valuable insights.

After you’ve created the report to your liking, you can use Copilot to create a narrative summary to better inform your consumers. Finally, consumers can also use Copilot in Reading mode to help explain or further summarize the report, reducing unanswered questions.

Remember that Copilot is there to assist you, not replace you. Your expertise is necessary to understand the data and Copilot will help you gain additional insights.
