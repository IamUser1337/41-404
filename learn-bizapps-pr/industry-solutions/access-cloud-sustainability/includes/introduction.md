Microsoft Sustainability Manager and other Microsoft Dataverse applications can load and use activities that produce greenhouse gas emissions, such as mobile combustion activities. Furthermore, you can process the data and produce actionable output, such as emission reduction opportunities and other analyses. 

Consistent visibility into your emissions activity and actionable insights allows you to adjust quickly, meet strict regulatory requirements, and accelerate the pace of progress.

You can use any programming language to access sustainability data through Microsoft Dataverse API.

This module includes exercises for you to learn how to:
- Access sustainability data through Dataverse API by using .NET 6 with Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
- Access sustainability data through Dataverse API by using .NET Framework with Microsoft Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for legacy scenarios.
- Build a Microsoft Azure Data Factory pipeline to copy sustainability data.
- Query sustainability data by using Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse.
