Store Operations Assist store managers can plan store tasks while considering the store department shifts start and end timings. Through integration with the Microsoft Teams Shifts app, Store Operations Assist can fetch shift-related information by using Microsoft Shifts API.

### Personas and scenarios

Store Operations Assist store managers at Contoso Retail want the capability of conveniently accessing the shift timings of their store associates. This access is crucial for efficient task planning. To facilitate this process, you act as Oscar Ward, the Microsoft Power Platform administrator, and set up integration between the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams and Store Operations Assist. This integration streamlines the workflow for Store Operations Assist administrators, eliminating the need to switch between Teams and the Store Operations Assist apps.

In this module, you assume the role of Oscar Ward, the Microsoft Power platform administrator of Contoso Retail, to complete the following exercises:

- **Create a schedule for store associates in Teams** - In this exercise, you set up the shift schedule for store associates and gather information that's necessary for the integration of Shifts in Store Operations Assist.

- **Enable Shifts integration** - In this exercise, you enable the integration between the Shifts app and Store Operations Assist.

- **Set up Shifts integration in Store Operations Assist** - In this exercise, you perform the steps that help you fetch the schedule from the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams to Store Operations Assist Admin.
