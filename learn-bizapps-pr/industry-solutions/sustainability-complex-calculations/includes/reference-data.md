In the winter of 2021, Contoso Corp, USA detected a supply chain issue where the demand for its products exceeded supply in the state of Texas and the Gulf Coast region of the United States. To meet this demand and optimize its operations and supply chain, Contoso Corp built a manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas and a warehouse in Fulshear, Texas. Fulshear is on the outskirts of the Houston metro area. Contoso Corp, USA has designated these new facilities as its operating unit for the Gulf Coast region and has named it Contoso, Texas.
