This module focused on the challenges that organizations face when looking to calculate their Scope 3 carbon emissions. You reviewed multiple methodologies and techniques to calculate Scope 3 emissions across Categories 1, 2, and 4. You also completed hands-on exercises to perform and review the Scope 3 calculations.

By using Sustainability Manager, you created new fields to track organization-specific data and ingested Scope 3 data. You reviewed and used existing calculation models as templates for creating new calculation models that fit the scenarios.

Additionally, you used Power FX expressions to integrate the newly created fields into the newly created calculation models. Later, you used calculation profiles to calculate emissions and then you reviewed the emission calculations output and the built-in Power BI dashboards to identify the sources of Scope 3 emissions.
