  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following options is an example of indirect emissions in Scope 3 Category 2?
    choices:
    - content: Goods and services sold
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Goods and services sold is an example of Scope 3 Category 10.
    - content: Downstream transportation and distribution
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Downstream transportation and distribution is an example of Scope 3 Category 9.
    - content: Procurement of goods and services
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Procurement of goods and services is an example of indirect emissions in Scope 3 Category 2 accounting, which covers emissions from the value chain of the reporting company.
    - content: Emissions that are generated by the organization's transportation vehicles
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Emissions that are generated by the organization's transportation vehicles are an example of Scope 1 emissions.
  - content: While youâ€™re using Sustainability Manager to perform calculations, which of the following options should you choose as a good practice related to the calculation model?
    choices:
    - content: Review the included emission factor libraries before setting up a new factor library.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Always review the included, out-of-the-box libraries before setting up a custom factory library.
    - content: Always build a new factor library that meets your calculation needs.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. If you always build new factor libraries, it might lead to duplicate emission factors and extra labor costs.
    - content: Use Microsoft Power Fx expressions or custom code for dynamic calculations.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Using Power Fx or custom code will add complexity and overhead to calculations. It's a good practice to use existing functionality, such as included emission factor libraries, in calculation models.
    - content: Use Microsoft Power Automate to extend the calculation model functionality.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Using Power Automate to extend calculation models will add more overhead to calculations. The goal might be better achieved by using existing functionality, such as the included emission factor libraries and factor mappings.
