The goal for Store Operations Assist integration with Microsoft Teams is to enhance the workflow and communication between different applications, facilitating a smoother operational experience.

You can now access requests originating from Store Operations Assist Teams within the Approvals app in Microsoft Teams. This integration removes the requirement to switch between Teams and Store Operations Assist app, resulting in a more efficient use of your time and resources.

This module provides a hands-on experience to the integration between the Microsoft Teams Approvals app and Store Operations Assist.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider the following limitations before completing the exercises in this module:
> - After your decision to approve or reject a request, the revised status of the request is promptly accessible to store associates in Store Operations Assist Teams. However, if the request is approved or rejected in Store Operations Assist Teams, it isn't reflected in the Approvals app.
> - After a store associate has created a request in Store Operations Assist Teams, the user who created it or the person to whom the request is assigned can't delete it.
> - After a request is synced to the Approvals app, it becomes read only. You can use Approvals to reassign the request, but this reassignment isn't reflected in Store Operations Assist Mobile. Therefore, when integration with Approvals is turned on, requests are read only and don't support attaching an image or reassignment.
