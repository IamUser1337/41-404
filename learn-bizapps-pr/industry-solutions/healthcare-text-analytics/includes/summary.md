By using Text Analytics for health, a feature of Azure Cognitive Services, you can convert unstructured health data into structured health data to enable further processing. In this module, you explored how to convert common unstructured data, such as patient visit summaries, to structured data with more insights added. You learned how to provision an Azure Cognitive Service Language resource, which allows you to use the service. By using that language resource with Language Studio, you were able to observe Text Analytics for health in action. Additionally, you explored the data in the service's output and learned how you could use that data for further analysis.
