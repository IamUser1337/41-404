Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare comes prebuilt with many functionalities out of the box. However, an extension mechanism is necessary for situations when customization is required.

Microsoft Industry Solution Clouds package the data model along with the relevant business processes, such as Microsoft Power BI, AI, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams integrations, and sample data that's built on top of Microsoft Azure. Hence, you have the flexibility to extend these components at each layer. If you intend to extend the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solution, multiple solution delivery mechanisms are available for independent software vendors (ISVs):

- If you're a horizontal ISV, then you provide applications that target business processes that are common to many industries and can build on one or more industry cloud data models.

- If you're an industry ISV or a customer who caters to a specific industry, such as healthcare, then you can build on top of the data model and extend vertical or micro-vertical scenarios, such as building a highly advanced patient engagement workflow in healthcare. Additionally, you can use the Internet Protocol (IP) or connectors from another ISV and build solutions that extend their IP.

- If you intend to publish your solutions and reach out to your customers, the delivery mechanism for industry solutions is available in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace. If you're a partner, then you can bring in the IP from multiple ISVs to extend and implement for your customers.

Multiple solution delivery models are available to Microsoft partners and providers to help bring value to customers.
