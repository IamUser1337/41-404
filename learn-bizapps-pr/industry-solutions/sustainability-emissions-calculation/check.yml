  questions:
  - content: What does a Calculation model represent
    choices:
    - content: A Calculation model dynamically connects activity data with greenhouse gas emissions
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Calculation model is a logical representation of the emission calculations.
    - content: A Calculation model is a logical representation of the emission calculations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A Calculation model is a logical representation of the emission calculations.
    - content: Calculation models can be run to dynamically calculate emissions with a set of activities
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Calculation model is a logical representation of the emission calculations.
    - content: Calculation models are Power Fx based calculations to calculate total emissions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Calculation model is a logical representation of the emission calculations.
  - content: What is the purpose of factor mappings?
    choices:
    - content: Factor mappings help map emission factors to reference data.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Factor mappings help map emission factors to reference data, such as contractual instruments.
    - content: Factor mappings help map emission data columns to factor libraries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Factor mappings help map emission factors to reference data, such as contractual instruments.
    - content: Factor mappings are unit conversion factors.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Factor mappings help map emission factors to reference data, such as contractual instruments.
    - content: Factor mappings help map factor libraries to activity data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Factor mappings help map emission factors to reference data, such as contractual instruments.
  - content: What is the purpose of estimation factors?
    choices:
    - content: Estimation factors are the same as emission factors.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Estimation factors and emission factors arenâ€™t the same.
    - content: Estimation factors are used to convert proxy data into activity data that you can use with emission factors.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Estimation factors help create estimated conversions from one unit type to another.
    - content: Estimation library is a library of emission factors.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Estimation factors help create estimated conversions from one unit type to another.
    - content: Estimation factors are required to calculate emissions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Estimation factors help create estimated conversions from one unit type to another.
  - content: In Microsoft Sustainability Manager, which component would you use for defining the steps and values to use for calculating emissions?
    choices:
    - content: Calculation job
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You would use the Calculation profile component to define the steps and the instruction sets for emission calculations.
    - content: Power Fx
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You would use the Calculation profile component to define the steps and the instruction sets for emission calculations.
    - content: Calculation profile
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You would use the Calculation profile component to define the steps and the instruction sets for emission calculations.
    - content: Emission library
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You would use the Calculation profile component to define the steps and the instruction sets for emission calculations.
