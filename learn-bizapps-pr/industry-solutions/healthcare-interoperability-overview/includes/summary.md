Integration and interoperability are crucial in the healthcare and life sciences industries. These capabilities help with creating a cohesive experience for patients, providers, and stakeholders. Integration brings together different systems, technologies, data sources and processes. Interoperability is the ability of different systems and data sources to exchange information. 

The traditional siloed nature of the healthcare industry, with different systems and technologies used by different providers and organizations resulted in inefficiencies and a lack of continuity of care. 

Electronic health records (EHRs) and health information exchanges (HIEs) are being used to address these challenges and to improve patient data sharing and care coordination. Interoperability is being addressed by using international standards, such as HL7, CDA, C-CDA, and FHIR.

The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare platform offers various capabilities, such as the following to address the challenges of data silos, standardization, complexity, security, and privacy: 

- Azure Health Data Services

- Health Bot Service

- Data Integration Toolkit

- Dataverse Healthcare APIs.
