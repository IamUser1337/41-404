By using Text Analytics for health, a feature of Azure Cognitive Services, you can convert unstructured health data into structured health data to enable further processing. In this module, you explored using Text Analytics for health as a cloud service or deploying it by using a Docker container. You learned how to use the REST API and the SDKs. You can use the REST API from any logic to make REST API requests and interpret the JSON response. Conversely, the SDKs provide a way for you to interact with the service. In the exercises, you used the SDK to access the service and deploy a Text Analytics for health container to your local computer.
