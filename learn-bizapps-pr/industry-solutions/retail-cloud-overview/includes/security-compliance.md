The following issues make security and compliance a unique challenge for the retail industry:

- A multitude of systems has always been in the retail space, from POS to CRM and other improvised systems across a wide network of stores, production centers, fulfillment centers, and corporations. Additionally, extensive apps, devices, and users have amassed across and outside of the corporate network. As the organizational barriers blur between who's in the network or not, organizations struggle to manage identities for their employees and external partners, suppliers, distributors, and even consumers, customers, or citizens.

- Retailers are more vulnerable to cyber attacks, especially identity and software supply chain attacks. The phrase "supply chain" in this context has a different meaning than the commonly understood meaning in retail related to logistics and transportation. Software supply chain security is the security of software code, which is traced back to its original sources and used by an entity and its external service providers throughout the full development and deployment life cycle.

- Consumer privacy is imperative, and it impacts a brand's reputation and value when it isn't protected. Retailed have to plan ahead and with trust-building at their core, seize the opportunity to define transparent, consumer-centric privacy standards

- Increasing compliance mandates have been established across the globe that pertains to customer privacy. Nearly half of US states are developing data policy legislation, meaning that a patchwork of law is established, making compliance confusing and complex to manage. 

## Security, identity, and threat protection

Microsoft helps you protect against the latest threats with intelligent tools to prevent attacks and react quickly to security events.

### Identity and access

Identity and access features provide:

- Benefits of a rich set of security capabilities from Microsoft Entra ID, including multifactor authentication and fine-grained Conditional Access policies.

- The ability to create access policies and use multifactor authentication based on specific retail personas, such as cashiers, managers, HR, and more.

- Microsoft's principle of Zero Standing Access (ZSA) to customer data. You can use Customer Lockbox to approve or reject customer data access requests in the exceptional situation where such access is needed.

### Encryption

Encryption features help you:

- Increase compliance and protect sensitive data with customer-managed keys (CMK).

- Use Azure private link and network isolation to help ensure private access to online services, and protect connectivity with TLS 1.2 Encryption in Transit.

- Use endpoint encryptions, based on devices and security needs, to accommodate a complex retail ecosystem.

### Threat protection

Threat protection provides you with the following benefits:

- Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. This single solution provides alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

- Microsoft services undergo external penetration tests, and we recommend that customers also validate by performing independent penetration tests to keep their environment secure.
