Using Text Analytics for health, a feature of Azure Cognitive Services, you can convert unstructured health data into structured health data to enable easier further processing. 

In this module, you:  

- explored how Text Analytics for health can output Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, pronounced fire) structured data. Having the output FHIR resource bundle enables interoperability with FHIR-compliant systems. 

- learnt how to configure your request to Text Analytics for health to request the FHIR resource bundle be produced in the output.
