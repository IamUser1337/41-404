## Review the Water quantity dashboard

To review the **Water quantity** dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Water quantity** tab.

   The **Water quantity** tab opens by default.

2. To filter this dashboard, select a reporting period. The dashboard is divided into the following categories:

   - Water withdrawn

   - Water discharged

   - Water consumed

   - Water recycled

    In the dashboard, the **Water withdrawn** and **Water discharged** tiles have five tabs:

     - By month (comparison)

     - By source

     - By facility

     - By country/region

     - By organizational unit

    The **Water consumed** and **Water recycled** tiles have four tabs:

     - By month (comparison)

     - By facility

     - By country/region

     - By organizational unit

    For the **By month (comparison)**, **By source**, **By facility**, **By country/region**, and **By organization unit** tabs, when you select a specific option, data for the selected reporting period shows accordingly. When you select the water quantity transaction again, the details around each tab in the top tile are as follows:

     - **By month (comparison)** - This tab shows the water quantity transaction breakdown by each month to compare.

     - **By source** - This tab shows a breakdown of the water quantity transaction by source.

     - **By facility, By country/region, and By organization unit** - These tabs show the water quantity transaction filtered by facility, country/region, and organization unit respectively.

3. Select the **Wide World Importers - Miami Office** and **Wide World Importers - Tampa Office** options.

The **Water quantity** report now shows water data analyzed with respect to all tabs that are available for each water quantity transaction.
