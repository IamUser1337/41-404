1.  To view the calculated churn scores, go to **Data**, and then under **Entities**, open the **msfsiRetailBankingChurn** entity that was created when you ran the churn model.

1.  On the **Attributes** tab, view the various new columns that were created by the model that factor into the score:

	- **ExpFeature1** = Contact related factors
	
	- **ExpFeature2** = Digital transaction factors
	
	- **ExpFeature3** = Physical transaction factors
	
	- **ExpFeature4** = Digital session factors
	
	- **ExpFeature5** = Physical session factors

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of the attributes list, showing the new columns that were added.](../media/attributes.png)

1.  Select the **Data** tab to view the calculated churn score for each **CustomerID** in the dataset.
