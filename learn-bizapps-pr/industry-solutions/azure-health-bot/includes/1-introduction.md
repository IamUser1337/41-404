The Microsoft Azure Health Bot service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy their AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experiences at scale. It allows businesses to offer your users intelligent and personalized access to health-related information and interactions through a natural conversation experience.

With the service, healthcare organizations can build a *health bot instance* and integrate it with their systems that patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives can interact with. Building an instance allows you to improve processes, services, outcomes, and cost.

Azure Health Bot service contains a built-in medical database, including triage protocols. You can also extend a health bot instance to include your own scenarios and integrate with other IT systems and data sources. For more information, see [Azure Health Bot Overview](/azure/health-bot/?azure-portal=true).
