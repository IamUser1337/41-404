   > [!NOTE]
   > In this exercise, you will be using an Office 365 E5 license which includes license to Microsoft Teams and other Office apps. In a real customer implementation, you might not require an E5 license and either Microsoft 365 F1 or F3 license can also be purchased. These licenses cost lesser and are sufficient for Store Operations Assist. Refer to the [prerequisites](/industry/retail/deploy-store-operations-assist) section to understand the minimum licensing requirements for Store Operations Assist.
