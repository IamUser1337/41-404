Microsoft Cloud for Retail includes solutions that are built on capabilities within Microsoft Power Platform. To set up these solutions, useâ€¯[Microsoft Cloud Solution Center](https://solutions.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

Solution Center guides you through and simplifies the deployment process. It checks licensing requirements and dependencies to ensure that you have everything you need for your deployment. In this exercise, you'll use Solution Center to deploy Store Operations Assist.

1. Go to [Microsoft Cloud Solution Center](https://solutions.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) in a new tab page in the same InPrivate or Incognito browser.
