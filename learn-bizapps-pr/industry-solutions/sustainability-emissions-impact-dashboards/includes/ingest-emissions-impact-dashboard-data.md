Microsoft Sustainability Manager integrates with the Emissions Impact dashboard through its connector framework. Organizations can use the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure connector to obtain the emissions data generated from their Microsoft Azure services into Microsoft Sustainability Manager. This data provides a unified view of the emissions from their operations and IT infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Azure emissions are directly related to Azure costs. As a result, the service principal that's used to read Azure emissions and the user who's creating the connection in Microsoft Sustainability Manager must have permission to read billing account data.

Before you can connect to the Emissions Impact Dashboard, you should complete the following steps:

1.  Set up a service principal.

    -   [Create a new service principal in the same tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal?azure-portal=true#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal) as Microsoft Sustainability Manager.

    -   Assign the Billing Account Reader role to the new service principal (or EnrollmentReader, if you're using an Enterprise Agreement account).

1. Ensure that the user who's creating the connection in Microsoft Sustainability Manager also has the Billing Account Reader role (or EnrollmentReader, if you're using an Enterprise Agreement account).

For more information, seeÂ [Assign roles to Azure Enterprise Agreement service principal names](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/assign-roles-azure-service-principals/?azure-portal=true).
