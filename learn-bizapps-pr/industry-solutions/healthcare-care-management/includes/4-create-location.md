1.  While in the **Active Accounts** view, select the **Lamna Healthcare Company** organization.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the Active Accounts view with Lamna Healthcare Company selected.](../media/lamna-healthcare-company.png)](../media/lamna-healthcare-company.png#lightbox)

1.  On the Lamna Healthcare Company record, select the **Related** tab and then scroll down to select **Locations**.

	> [![Screenshot of the account summary with the Related tab open and Locations selected.](../media/related-locations.png)](../media/related-locations.png#lightbox)

The newly created **Lamna Healthcare - Redmond, WA** location will show as associated with the record.

You've now created a new location in Redmond, WA for Lamna Healthcare Company and have viewed it in the associated organization in the Care Management application.

In this module, you explored the Administration section of the Care Management application. In your own time, you can continue through the other sections of the application, including Care Management, Clinical Data, and Templates.
