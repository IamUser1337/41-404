DICOM® is an important standard for enabling interoperable exchange of medical imaging data. You can store images and transmit them between systems, such as DICOM-compatible devices, PACS systems, vendor neutral archives (VNAs), and more.

The DICOM® service within Azure Health Data Services helps health organizations to persist medical imaging data in the Microsoft cloud in a more secure manner. The DICOM service is a managed Azure service that allows standards-based communication with any DICOMweb™ enabled systems. 

By using the DICOM service as a building block in Azure Health Data Services, you can realize novel solutions in storing, connecting, and using medical imaging data to help improve health outcomes.
