In this exercise, you create a patient journey for the patient segment that you created in the first exercise. A patient journey can expand your organization's patient outreach marketing capabilities by helping healthcare organizations guide the members of a selected segment through the communication process. It completes this action by using automated messaging, activity generation, interactive decision points, and more.

Now let’s make our own patient journey for patients with hypermetropia.

1. In the **Patient Outreach** app, in the lower-left corner select **Change area** dropdown and then select **Patient journeys**. 

1. On the left navigation pane, under **Engagement**, select **Journeys**. 

1. In the command toolbar, select **+ New journey** to create a new patient journey.

1. After your patient journey starts, you'll be able to gather key metrics and insights from the record.
