Using the entire meetings platform in Microsoft Teams, providers can schedule, manage, and conduct virtual consultation with patients. With the Microsoft Teams integration, practitioners get a full view of their patient's information and history.

After coming home from hiking, Reed noticed a new rash on the right arm and leg. Reed decides to schedule a virtual appointment to get a diagnosis.

In this lab, you'll first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator. You'll configure the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare to be used for virtual appointments. Then you'll play the role of Reed by scheduling a virtual appointment with Reed's practitioner. Following this, you'll be able to join the virtual appointment from the view of a practitioner to observe the complete end-to-end experience.
