1. Go to the app registration page with the following URL: `https://yourtenant.SharePoint.com/sites/yoursitepath/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`. Enter the tenant's name in place of **yourtenant**. Enter the SharePoint site name in place of **yoursitepath** to change according to the tenant and the SharePoint site used to read the **Product prices** file (PriceData.json).

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also copy the URL of the SharePoint site that you're using for this exercise up to the site name and then append `_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`.

1. Enter the following information in the fields:

   **Title** - Contoso store

   **App Domain** - `www.contoso.com`

   **Redirect URL** - `https://www.contoso.com/default.aspx`

   > [![Screenshot of SharePoint in a browser showing that the app identifier has been successfully created.](../media/create-registration.png)](../media/create-registration.png#lightbox)

1. Now that you're registered the application, you need to grant it permission to read data. Go to `https://yourtenant.SharePoint.com/sites/yoursitepath/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`. Enter the tenant's name in place of **yourtenant**. Enter the SharePoint site name in place of **yoursitepath** to change according to the tenant and the SharePoint site used to read the **Product prices** file (PriceData.json).
