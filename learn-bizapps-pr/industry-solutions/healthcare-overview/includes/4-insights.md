With Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, you can take action with your data to realize savings and achieve better outcomes.

Additionally, with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, you can:

- Transform data into predictive insights to support better care management by replacing data silos with centralized, analytics-driven platforms. Use machine learning and/or AI to manage data efficiently and to share predictive guidance that helps clinical teams provide better care.

- Reduce variation in care and improve the quality of outcomes at a lower cost. This feature helps accelerate the transition to value-based care and intervene early to reduce costs, automate duplicative tasks, and use predictive analytics to identify trends and suggest actions.

- Decrease costs by automating processes, automating duplicative tasks, preventing costly downtime from equipment failures and inventory shortages, and using AI to manage data efficiently. With this feature, you can better manage expensive resources with processes such as predictive maintenance.

- Increase revenue opportunities by replacing data silos with centralized, analytics-driven platforms. Identify future markets and areas for new investments, drive strategic pricing models, and enable facilities to reach sustainability goals.

The following sections explain the key features that help unlock the value of clinical and operational data.

## Clinical analytics

With the **Clinical analytics** solution, you can use insights to improve health team efficiency by deploying AI-driven predictive analytics for data modeling and risk assessments.

Data insights are beneficial for more than simply managing supplies and facilities. When providers ingest and enrich patient data more securely, customers can reveal actionable insights that lead to better health outcomes and more satisfying patient experiences. By unifying cross-institutional data on a single platform, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare helps customers access and share actionable data more securely to improve patient care.

Key features in clinical analytics include:

- **Population health** - Support population health using Microsoft Azure Healthcare APIs to compare clinical patient data against massive datasets of structured and unstructured population health information.

- **Predictive care guidance** - Provide predictive, personalized care by analyzing unified datasets with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and by sharing insights through clinician dashboards.

- **Virtual health** - Connect remotely with patients by using Microsoft Azure IoT Hub to ingest data from remote Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and present that information directly in Microsoft Teams.

## Operational analytics

With the **Operational analytics** solution, you can sync operational and financial data to reveal actionable insights to improve efficiency and reduce costs and waste.

Healthcare organizations must manage more than patient care. Administrative tasks are crucial for ensuring that customers have the supplies and facilities to support patients, but they must be managed efficiently to ensure that costs stay manageable. By using a newly unified data estate on Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, customers can gain actionable insights that help optimize operations.

Key features in operational analytics include:

- **Resource management** - Optimize supply chain, staffing, and cost management by using Azure Healthcare APIs to unify datasets and reveal actionable insights into cross-institutional operations.

- **Claims collaboration** - Establish a streamlined, collaborative claims approval process by unifying claims datasets and using data connectors to show key insights in Microsoft Teams.

- **Patient throughput** - Provide better throughput and readmissions management by ingesting IoT data through the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR to establish actionable insights into supply and facility use.

## Performance analytics  

As part of the Cloud for Healthcare solution, the **Performance analytics** solution is powered by Nuance Performance Analytics. With performance analytics, you can provide constant monitoring and trend analysis to help assess clinical and financial performance for populations, readmissions, quality measures, and more.
