Microsoft uses the data standards that are important to healthcare. Every organization needs to safeguard their business, customers, and data, particularly in this era of AI. Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare functions with trust in mind, helping every organization build safety and responsibility into their AI journey from the beginning.

The following sections discuss how healthcare is currently in transition and how Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare helps transform the healthcare journey.

## Key healthcare challenges in an AI era

Over the last two years, healthcare organizations confront the burden of an unprecedented volume of challenging moments that forced many to rethink established norms and operational best practices. In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, several key challenges emerged that require careful consideration and innovative solutions. For these challenges, ranging from workforce shortage issues to data management complexities, healthcare organizations seek to adapt and thrive in the modern era.

Burnout has reached crisis levels, and burnout among health workers has harmful consequences for patient care and safety. Some consequences include decreased time spent between providers and patients, increased medical errors, and a shortage of workers when clinicians leave the profession. Surveys show that between 35-54% of clinicians are suffering burnout.

A current projection shows a possible worldwide shortage of 10 million frontline healthcare workers by 2030. This projection emphasizes the importance for healthcare organizations, people, and technology to adapt and find a new purpose in unpredictable contexts.

Modern healthcare organizations have data coming from multiple sources. In fact, up to 80% of the time that providers spend analyzing data is wasted on ingestion and unification. Currently, the amount of data that's being created, shared, and stored is growing exponentially. Moreover, the requirements to keep this data secure, private, and compliant are more complex.

Healthcare systems need to connect the physical and digital experiences so that they can better serve patients in new and more personalized ways. As a result, patients can receive specialized care where, when, and how they need it.

Reimagining the next healthcare era involves continued agility in responding rapidly and predicting what’s next. This reimagining requires a new approach to healthcare solutions, one that harnesses data as a resource and turns its potential into power.
