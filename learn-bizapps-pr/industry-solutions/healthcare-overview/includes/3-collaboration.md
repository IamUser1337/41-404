## Care management

Effective care management is essential in improving patient health outcomes. With Dynamics 365, health organizations can organize patient care activities and share information among stakeholders. Health organizations can manage complex workflows from a single application to effectively manage cases and minimize costs, especially for patients with chronic illnesses or long-term care plans.

Key features in care management include:

- **Care management** - With Dynamics 365, you can view and manage care team member organization, gain dashboard views of prioritized patient needs and appointments, and manage and personalize care plans. Microsoft Teams also works seamlessly with Dynamics 365. From the Teams app, customers can set up and customize teams with templates for settings, channels, and preinstalled apps. Additionally, customers can customize policies for uses with similar roles.

- **EHR integration** - Integrate existing EHRs and external apps more securely. Use the Patients app to curate a list of high-risk patients that must be monitored and pull their latest details from the EHR system. The Patients app supports FHIR DSTU2 and STU3 versions through parsing of a conformance statement. It also includes audit logs for all view and search actions on its user interface to safeguard personal health information (PHI) according to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines.

- **Resource optimization** - With Resource Scheduling Optimization in Dynamics 365, customers can optimize the personnel, equipment, and schedules for real-time patient needs. 

- **Home health** - Empower frontline healthcare workers and care team members with tools to accelerate care, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service. This tool gives the optimal route to meet patients anywhere and prepares contact centers with context, relevant knowledge articles, scripts, and workstreams to address patient issues.
