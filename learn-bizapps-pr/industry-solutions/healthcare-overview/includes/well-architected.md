The **Well-Architected for Industry** framework, as described, is a set of guiding principles designed to enhance the quality of industry-specific cloud workloads. It applies the established five pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework to Microsoft Cloud for industry solutions that helps to produce a high-quality, stable, and efficient industry cloud architecture:

-   Reliability

-   Security

-   Cost optimization

-   Operational excellence

-   Performance efficiency

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of Well-Architected Framework pillars and investment areas:
