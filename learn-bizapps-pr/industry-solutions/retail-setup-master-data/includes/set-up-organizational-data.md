## Task: Define target groups

Target groups help you group retail stores that usually perform the same tasks. A target group can consist of any combination of retail stores. However, in most cases, we recommend that you group retail stores that share similar characteristics so that you can implement the same tasks in those retail stores.

In this task, you create target groups and assign retail stores to the respective target groups.

1. On the left pane, select **Target groups**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the left navigation pane with Target groups highlighted.](../media/target-groups-navigation.png)](../media/target-groups-navigation.png#lightbox)

1. Select **New** on the upper command bar to create a new target group.

1. In the **Name** field, enter **Contoso Stores** and then select **Save** on the upper command bar to save the record.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the Target group page with Name set to Contoso Stores.](../media/target-groups-create.png)](../media/target-groups-create.png#lightbox)

1. On the lower grid (**Members** tab), select **New Target group member** to assign a business unit to the target group.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the New Target group member option.](../media/new-target-group-member-button.png)](../media/new-target-group-member-button.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Contoso Store 101** as the **Store/Department** and then select **Save & Close**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the New Target group member form with details filled in.](../media/new-target-group-member.png)](../media/new-target-group-member.png#lightbox)

1. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add other Contoso stores to this target group. Also, repeat steps 2 to 6 to create a new target group, Fabrikam Store, and add the respective Fabrikam stores to that target group.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use Excel import to perform a bulk import and add stores to a target group. Alternatively, you can create new target groups by following the Excel import steps in the first task of this exercise.
