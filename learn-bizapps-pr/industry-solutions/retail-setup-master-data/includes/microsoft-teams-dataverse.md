In this exercise, you'll set up Microsoft Dataverse security. In this exercise, you'll assume the role of Oscar, the system administrator, and perform the following tasks:

## Task: Create territories

You can use territories to group stores or business units in the same organizational hierarchy. In this task, you set up the territories for the Contoso Retail and Fabrikam Retail stores. 

1. Go to [Microsoft Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true) (we recommend that you use an Incognito or InPrivate browsing session). Ensure that you're in the correct environment. 

1. On the left navigation pane, selectâ€¯**Apps**. Select the play button that appears near **Store Operations Assist**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of running Store Operations Assist.](../media/play-soa-app.png)](../media/play-soa-app.png#lightbox)

1. In Store Operations Assist, select **App setup** from the area list in the bottom left corner.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Territories**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Territories selected.](../media/territories-navigation.png)](../media/territories-navigation.png#lightbox)

1. Select **New** on the upper command bar to create a new territory.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the New button on the All Territories page.](../media/new-territory.png)](../media/new-territory.png#lightbox)

1. Enter **Redmond** in the **Territory Name** field and then select **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of Redmond entered as the territory name.](../media/redmond-territory.png)](../media/redmond-territory.png#lightbox)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the list of All Territories.](../media/all-territories.png)](../media/all-territories.png#lightbox)

## Task: Create business units

A business unit represents the hierarchy of a retail organization, from the headquarters down to the stores, such as Headquarters > District > Store > Department. With the Store Operations Assist solution, you can create any level of hierarchy that reflects your organizational structure.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the Contoso organizational hierarchy.](../media/contoso-hierarchy.svg)](../media/contoso-hierarchy.svg#lightbox)

In this task, you create and import business units for various stores and regions and then assign them to appropriate territories and store managers. The business units data from the CSV file illustrates the organizational structure depicted in the organizational hierarchy. 

Typically, regional managers are assigned to the respective regional business units, such as Redmond, New York, and San Francisco, so that they can access the data from the stores within their purview. The store managers, customer assistants, and store associates have access to the respective stores so that they can access the data only from their stores.

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Business units**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Business units highlighted.](../media/business-units-navigation.png)](../media/business-units-navigation.png#lightbox)

1. Copy the default business unit value displayed on the screen. 

1. Open the sample **Business Unit.csv** file. Download and extract the sample data from the [Business unit zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/blob/master/retail-cloud/BusinessUnit.zip).

1. Change the **Parent Business** value of the highlighted cells in that column to the default business unit value in your environment. This value displays when you open the business units on the left navigation pane. Similarly, change the **Manager** value in the highlighted cells in that column with the **MCR IAD Manager** value that you're using.

1. Select **Finish Import** in the lower-right corner of the screen.

1. To track the progress of the import, go to Power Apps (we recommend that you use an Incognito or InPrivate browsing session).

1. Sign in with your MCR IAD Manager credentials.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For instructor-led training, use the credentials that your instructor has provided; for self-paced learning, use the credentials that have been generated in the Training Environment preparation module.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're in an instructor-led training, use the store manager user ID that your instructor has provided. If you're in self-paced learning, use the store manager user ID that's created in the training environment section.
   >
   > If you don't find Monica in the users list, sign in with Monica's credentials into Store Operations Assist so that Monica's record is auto created in the Users table in the environment.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the Users page with focus on the Change business unit button and the search for Monica.](../media/change-business-unit.png)](../media/change-business-unit.png#lightbox)

## Task: Create teams in Microsoft Teams

In this task, you create three Microsoft Teams: **Contoso Store 101 Managers**, **Contoso Store 101 Associates**, and **Contoso Retail Managers**. Ideally, a system administrator [sets up the team hierarchy](/microsoftteams/set-up-your-team-hierarchy/?azure-portal=true) before creating the teams in Microsoft Teams. However, in this task, you have to manually create the Microsoft Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're in instructor-led training, set your user number as a prefix in the team name to make it unique.

1. Go to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) in an InPrivate or Incognito browser session.
