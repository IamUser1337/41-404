Water sustainability enables organizations to record, estimate, analyze, and report on water quantity and quality data to meet use cases such as water sustainability disclosures and regulatory water quality reporting. 

Sustainable waste management features in Sustainability Manager enable organizations to unify, prepare, analyze, and report on waste quantity and quality characteristics. Use cases include filing sustainability disclosures and meeting compliance requirements on hazardous and radioactive waste sent to landfills.
