While the overall value proposition of Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services encompasses the full extent of the financial services industry, the solution templates discussed in this module focus on the retail banking and to some extent the wealth management subverticals of this broad industry.

Leaders in the banking industry are focused on helping their organizations weather storms and adapt to relentless change. Challenges range from developing customer expectations and workforce transformation to competitive threats and innovation imperatives counterbalanced by risk, security, and regulatory compliance considerations. Financial services institutions need to make financial, cultural, and technological investments to address these challenges, stay competitive, and prepare for an uncertain future.

The pressures and crises that recently beset the banking industry highlight the general volatility of financial markets against the backdrop of profound global economic, environmental, and geopolitical change. In addition, the imperative to cut costs and enable new efficiencies--while at the same time continuing to push programs of digital innovation that yield greater differentiation and potential for revenue growth in a cutthroat competitive environment--remains critical.

Here's a summary of the banking industry trends that fuel the above mentioned challenges and the need for banks to act:

- **Changing customer expectations** - Increasingly, customers expect a more personalized banking experience. The importance of the customer experience is magnified when you put it in the context of the customer journey, that is, all the points at which customers encounter the bank at different times, in different channels, and with different needs. To provide better service and more meaningful interactions, bank employees need a complete view of their customers.

- **Workforce Transformation** - The industry’s most important assets are its employees, who drive bank operations and manage customer engagement and service. Whether onsite or remote, employees with the right communications and collaboration tools are more effective in addressing business needs and servicing customers.

- **Competitive pressures** - Banks face threats from both traditional competitors in their own field, and also from nontraditional competitors, such as challenger banks, fintechs, and born-in-the-cloud “neo” banks. These competitors enter the financial business and disrupt the typical way in which banks engage with customers.

- **Innovation imperatives** - In addition to allowing banks to stay competitive, innovation is critical to meeting changing customer expectations, tapping into new markets, creating new efficiencies, and developing new business models. By introducing new products, services and processes, banks can differentiate themselves from their competitors, attract new customers, and better retain existing ones. Additionally, innovation focused on streamlining business processes through the application of automation and AI can also lead to cost savings across the organization.

- **Risk, security, and compliance** - Year after year, banks are asked to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements and cybersecurity controls worldwide. The complex regulatory environment puts burdensome demands on financial institutions to provide regular reporting to various regulatory bodies. Banks thus seek technology solutions that enable them to better comply with regulations, and better protect their organizations and their customers.

- **Advancing sustainable finance** - The extraordinary, time-sensitive challenge to stabilize society through achieving global net-zero emissions is top of mind in banking and financial services industry-wide. The challenge is to accelerate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) progress and make sustainability good for businesses.

As a result, banks are looking for a new approach to pave the way for the future. With these priorities in mind, banks are prioritizing cloud services to drive digital transformation because of the ability to speed up deployment, lower complexity, and manage upfront investment.

## Industry scenarios
