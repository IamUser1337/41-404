Defining all attributes of the organization up front is important. For example, some organizations require you to segregate data by units. This approach requires accounting for the use of different units of measurements in different countries/regions. Some countries/regions use imperial units, while others use the metric system. This difference impacts calculations and formulas. 

Understanding this level of detail will help you create a blueprint for the organization in this solution. Defining attributes properly at the start will help set up the organization for success with a solid configuration and an architecture that can scale.
