Connect it to specific scenarios so that configuration and adoption can scale in future iterations as you bring in more activity from emissions sources and organization units/facilities.

- **Implement** - Start small and keep growing. Take an incremental approach.

- **Prepare** - Take advantage of the in-app configuration guide that gives contextual and actionable guidance with assets for every step of the configuration journey. The guide provides the Microsoft-recommended configuration path to support success in adoption, helping organizations realize value faster.

- **Operate** - Continue to improve your approach to reduce, replace, or remove your footprint across how your products and facilities are sourced, manufactured, operated, and managed at end-of-life.
