In this module, you learned that Microsoft cloud tools make it possible for near-real time data to be ingested from medical IoT devices, normalized for FHIRÂ® compliance, stored in a secure environment, and then queried and displayed to end users for real-world action. Also, you learned that open source and managed service options for IoT device data connectivity are available within Azure.

MedTech service and other components in Azure Health Data Services work together effectively to ensure ease of ingesting and querying medical IoT data in a more secure environment. With MedTech service, you can use IoT devices to complete tasks, such as collecting IoT data and issuing clinical alerts for risk factors or collecting patient-reported outcomes for a more effective health care plan.
