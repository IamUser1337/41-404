  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: The data from weekly weigh-ins, which is automatically reported by scales with IoT connectivity, would be considered what type of health data?
    choices: 
    - content: High velocity data
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The expected volume with a weekly reading and the relatively simple data to report makes weekly weigh-ins low velocity data.
    - content: Low velocity data
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. The expected volume with a weekly reading and the relatively simple data to report makes weekly weigh-ins low velocity data.
    - content: Neither of these options
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The expected volume with a weekly reading and the relatively simple data to report makes weekly weigh-ins low velocity data.
  - content: Which one of the following options is a benefit of IoT devices?
    choices: 
    - content: Improved doctor/patient engagement
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. All are benefits of IoT devices.
    - content: Patient accountability
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. All are benefits of IoT devices.
    - content: Increased patient compliance with treatment plans
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. All are benefits of IoT devices.
    - content: All of these options
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. All are benefits of IoT devices.
  - content: How does IoT device data become useable data?
    choices: 
    - content: Device data is normalized and transformed into a FHIRÂ® Observation resource that is useable by your custom, or industry, healthcare apps.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Messages from the device are grouped and normalized. After that the IoT connector transforms them into a normalized schema to become useable data.
    - content: Making device data useable is dependent on the intended outcome/use case.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Messages from the device are grouped and normalized. After that the IoT connector transforms them into a normalized schema to become useable data.
    - content: Normalizing and transforming data is only possible with high-code proprietary offerings.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Messages from the device are grouped and normalized. After that the IoT connector transforms them into a normalized schema to become useable data.
