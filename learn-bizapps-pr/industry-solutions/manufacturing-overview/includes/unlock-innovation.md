The following scenarios offer solutions that help manufacturers ideate, design, prototype, test, manage, and validate their products digitally.

## Digital twins and simulation

Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing empowers the manufacturing industry with advanced capabilities in digital twins and simulation. These capabilities help manufacturers create data representations for physical products, assets, and factories. Manufacturers can harness the power of Microsoft Azure and simulate various scenarios to optimize product design, improve processes, and make informed factory setup decisions with greater speed and reduced data sampling. With the ability to create and manage product digital twins, manufacturers can use high-performance computing in the cloud to conduct sophisticated experiments, such as computational fluid dynamics and mixing simulations.

The top digital twins and simulation use cases that Microsoft supports include:

- **Digital twins** - Digital twin technology allows manufacturers to design and simulate products, machines, and processes by using near real-time data. The technology creates a digital representation of the object, from simple twins like dashboards to complex 3D models. Additionally, digital twins use machine learning to anticipate outcomes based on historical data and algorithms that are specific to parts, systems, and assemblies. Microsoft Azure streamlines the development and use of digital twins by helping manufacturers consolidate various data sources, such as establishing an authoritative source of truth. By migrating these sources to Azure, you can integrate data that was previously isolated on-premises to power digital twins, thus unlocking valuable insights.

    -	Enterprise resource planning (ERP)

    -	Manufacturing execution system (MES)

    -	Master data management (MDM)

    -	Additive layer manufacturing (ALM)

    -	Other line-of-business (LOB) systems

- **Simulation on Azure** - Azure high-performance computing capabilities allow for more comprehensive assessments and optimization of product designs under a range of conditions, which contributes to a more efficient and accurate development process. These simulations are instrumental in identifying potential risk issues, allowing for preemptive solutions and improvements before manufacturers move into physical prototyping, which results in significant time and resource savings. Azure's high-performance computing capabilities offer scalable resources for handling complex simulations. Azure facilitates more efficient collaboration among global design and engineering teams because people can achieve shared access to simulations in real time, regardless of location.

- **Digital threads** - A digital thread is a framework that establishes a closed-loop communication system between the physical and digital worlds to optimize products, people, processes, and places. A digital thread facilitates knowledge sharing across all stages of a product's life cycle, effectively closing the loop. This communication results in improved data continuity, cross-department collaboration, and overall enhanced processes. Azure provides world-class security, edge technology, IoT support, and high-performance and confidential computing. Its AI and machine learning capabilities unlock insights from data that's processed in the digital thread.

## Product life cycle and design 

Product life cycle and design solutions on the cloud transform the way that manufacturers design, produce, and bring products to market. By using the power of cloud-based design tools and collaboration platforms, manufacturers can optimize their product development processes, reduce time-to-market, and improve overall product quality. An Azure cloud-based environment that's integrated with the following areas from Microsoft ISV partners provides a comprehensive, connected, and highly efficient approach to manufacturing design and product life cycle management.

- Product lifecycle management (PLM)

- Computer-Aided Design (CAD)

- Simulation tools 

The top product life cycle and design use cases that Microsoft supports include:

- **PLM on Azure** - PLM solutions help manufacturers manage their digital product definition and configuration across the manufacturing life cycle from a single source of truth. It allows greater engineering collaboration during the product development phases and boosts operational efficiency with increased speed to market. Manufacturers can migrate on-premises PLM solutions to Azure and use advanced analytics while reducing overall infrastructure and maintenance costs. The scalability and flexibility of Azure allows organizations to manage product data and workflows, integrate with other business systems, and adapt to changing business needs.

- **CAD on Azure** - The integration of PLM systems on Azure also streamlines the management of design assets throughout their life cycles, from initial design to end-of-life. This integrated approach streamlines workflows, accelerates product development, and fosters innovation, demonstrating the value of using Design on Azure in manufacturing. Microsoft Azure provides all necessary cloud infrastructure, tools, and services that enhance manufacturing design. Its compatibility with various CAD software means that you can choose the tools that are best suited to your specific needs and preferences. High-performance GPUs that are available on Azure can significantly accelerate rendering and simulation tasks within CAD applications. Additionally, powerful cloud-based collaboration tools from Azure allow for real-time sharing and modification of CAD models among distributed teams, which enhances collaboration and efficiency.

- **Azure database migration** - Transitioning to full stack Azure SQL Databases with Azure SQL Managed Instance is a transformative move for organizations, offering a highly scalable, more secure, and cost-effective platform for running business-critical applications. The shift to Azure SQL Databases eliminates the need for significant hardware investments, diminishes maintenance costs, and boosts overall application performance. Azure SQL Databases are recognized for their security measures and reliable performance when you're operating applications. They're designed to offer solid protection for your data against unauthorized access and various cybersecurity threats. The migration process to Azure SQL Databases is highly flexible, and you can tailor it to cater to the unique needs of your organization, ensuring minimal downtime and disruption.
