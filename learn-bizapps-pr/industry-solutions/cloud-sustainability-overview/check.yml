  questions:
  - content: What is the unified unit of metric to calculate the carbon emissions?
    choices:
    - content: CO<sub>2</sub>e
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. All greenhouse gas emissions are converted to a unified unit of measurement, carbon dioxide equivalent.
    - content: GWP
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the potency with which each gas traps heat from the sun.
    - content: Kwh
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Kwh is a unit to calculate the energy consumed per hour.
    - content: Fahrenheit
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Fahrenheit denotes scale of temperature.
  - content: Which scope includes supply chain emissions of an organization?
    choices:
    - content: Scope 1
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions of organizations.
    - content: Scope 2
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Scope 2 emissions are generated from indirect emissions, such as purchased energy or purchased heat.
    - content: Scope 3
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Supply chain emissions upstream and downstream are categorized as Scope 3 emissions.
    - content: None of the above
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Supply chain emissions of an organization are categorized as Scope 3 emissions.
  - content: What phrase best represents carbon negative?
    choices:
    - content: Reduce emissions and/or pay others to not emit an equivalent to their remaining emissions
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Organizations that reduce emissions and/or pay others to not emit an equivalent to their remaining emissions are carbon neutral.
    - content: Remove as much carbon as the organization emits
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Organizations that remove the emissions that they've generated are carbon zero.
    - content: Remove more carbon than emitted each year
