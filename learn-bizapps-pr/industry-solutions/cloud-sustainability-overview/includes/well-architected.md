The "Well-Architected for Industry" framework, as described, is a set of guiding principles designed to enhance the quality of industry-specific cloud workloads. It applies the existing five pillars of Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework to Microsoft Cloud for industry solutions that helps produce high-quality, stable, and efficient industry cloud architecture:

- Reliability

- Security

- Cost optimization

- Operational excellence

- Performance efficiency

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of Well-Architected Framework pillars and investment areas:
