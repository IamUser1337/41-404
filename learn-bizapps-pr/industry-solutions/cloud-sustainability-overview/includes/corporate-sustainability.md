The [Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en/?azure-portal=true) is the EU's updated guideline for companies to report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. Effective from 2023, it replaces the older Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), ensuring businesses in Europe adhere to the new EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The CSRD aims to streamline and standardize sustainability reporting, replacing a wide range of existing sustainability reporting standards and frameworks.

Starting in 2024, organizations need to take annual compliance steps to meet the CSRD directive.

To help organizations address emerging ESG reporting requirements, Microsoft has introduced new reporting capabilities in Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability. These capabilities are designed to help organizations understand their compliance posture, track required actions, and document evidence for compliance initiatives.

Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager helps your organization manage your compliance needs, including assessing data protection risks, implementing controls, staying updated with regulations, and reporting to auditors. The introduction of CSRD expands its capability to also support sustainability reporting.

The CSRD template in [Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager](/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-manager/?azure-portal=true) helps organizations get CSRD-ready by documenting and reporting evidence aligned to preliminary European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). This  template helps organizations to collect the data they need for ESG reporting, and also evolve when new standards are adopted.
