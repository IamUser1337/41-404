In this module, you learned about the integration and interoperability solutions that are available in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. The solutions include Azure Health Data Services, Data integration toolkit, Dataverse Healthcare API, Healthcare data pipeline template, and virtual health data tables. Additionally, you reviewed the Virtual Health Data Tables solution and built your own model-driven app by using the available virtual health data tables. With the hands-on lab experience, you built your own solutions by using FHIR-based data elements.

In this module, you completed the following tasks:

-   Set up an Azure Health Data Services workspace and FHIR API.

-   Set up the Healthcare data pipeline to move data between FHIR server and Microsoft Dataverse.

-   Set up a model-driven app that connects directly to FHIR server by using virtual health data tables.
