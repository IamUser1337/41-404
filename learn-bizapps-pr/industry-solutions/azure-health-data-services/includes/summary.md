Azure Health Data Services is a set of managed API services that are based on open standards and frameworks that enable workflows to improve healthcare and offer scalable and more secure healthcare solutions. The service also supports connectors that bridge the egress of data to authorized users or applications.

In this module, you learned about the most common challenges to interoperability and how Azure Health Data Services uses the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standards to address these challenges. Now, you should have a high-level understanding of the key components of Azure Health Data Services, which include workspaces, [The FHIR® service](/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview), [The DICOM® service](/azure/healthcare-apis/dicom/dicom-services-overview), and [The MedTech service](/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/overview).
